<h3 id="1.45">Version <a href="#1.45">1.45</a> (Jan 27, 2019):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Removed the <code>Deencapsulation.setField</code> methods, which were deprecated in version 1.44.</li>
   <li>
      Added a warning (printed to standard output) for <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> methods that target a <code>private</code>
      method or constructor.
      The intent is to disallow such mock methods in a future version.

<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>withArgThat(Matcher)</code> method (available in the <code class="type">Expectations</code> and

<ul>
   <li>
      JMockit now requires the use of the "<code>-javaagent</code>" JVM initialization parameter.

</ul>

<h3 id="1.40">Version <a href="#1.40">1.40</a> (Jun 24, 2018):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      JMockit now requires JDK 1.7+ for test execution. Support for JDK 1.6 was dropped.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code class="type">maxInstances</code> attribute of the <code>@Capturing</code>
      annotation, which was deprecated in version 1.39.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code class="type">FullVerificationsInOrder</code> class, which was deprecated in version 1.39.

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.39">Version <a href="#1.39">1.39</a> (Mar 25, 2018):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>maxInstances</code> attribute of the
      <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> annotation.
      This attribute provides a feature which is probably never used, and if used makes for difficult to understand
      tests; existing tests using it (if any) should either be removed or rewritten.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code class="type">FullVerificationsInOrder</code> class.
      Existing tests using it, if any, can replace the one expectation block with two, a
      <code class="type">VerificationsInOrder</code> block containing the verified expectations, followed by an empty
      <code class="type">FullVerifications</code> block.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>MockUp#getMockInstance()</code> method, which was deprecated in version 1.37.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>unverifiedInvocations()</code> and <code>verifiedInvocations(...)</code>
      methods, which were deprecated in version 1.38.
   </li>
   <li>
      Issues closed:
      <a href="https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1/issues/504">#504</a>,

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.38">Version <a href="#1.38">1.38</a> (Dec 31, 2017):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped</strong> the support for <em>named</em> user-defined subclasses of
      <code class="type">Expectations</code> and <code class="type">Verifications</code>, for simplicity and improved
      performance.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>unverifiedInvocations()</code> and <code>verifiedInvocations(...)</code>
      methods from the <code class="type">VerificationsInOrder</code> and <code class="type">FullVerifications</code>
      classes.
      These methods support "partially ordered verification", a feature which is probably never used, and if used make
      for difficult to understand tests; existing tests using them (if any) should either be removed or rewritten.
   </li>
   <li>
      Issues closed:

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.37">Version <a href="#1.37">1.37</a> (Nov 26, 2017):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>getMockInstance()</code> method from the <code class="type">MockUp</code>
      class.
      Normally, this method is only used to obtain an instance of a faked <em>interface</em>.
      For faked <em>classes</em>, it has no practical use.
      Instead of using a mock-up for an interface type, it's recommended to create a minimal implementation class, or
      to use an existing implementation.
      See deprecation comments in the API documentation.

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.36">Version <a href="#1.36">1.36</a> (Oct 29, 2017):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code class="type">StrictExpectations</code> class, deprecated in version 1.35.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the "<code>invoke</code>" and "<code>newInstance</code>" methods from the
      <code class="type">Deencapsulation</code> class, deprecated in version 1.35.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the "<code>MockUp(T)</code>" constructor from the <code class="type">MockUp</code> class,
      deprecated in version 1.35.
   </li>
   <li>
      Issues closed:
      <a href="https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1/issues/463">#463</a>,

      <a href="https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1/issues/473">#473</a>.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.35">Version <a href="#1.35">1.35</a> (Sep 24, 2017):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code class="type">StrictExpectations</code> class.
      Existing tests should instead use <code class="type">Expectations</code>, possibly adding a
      "<code>new FullVerifications() {}</code>" block at the end, if detecting unrecorded invocations is still desired.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the "<code>invoke</code>" and "<code>newInstance</code>" methods from the
      <code class="type">Deencapsulation</code> class.
      These are simple Reflection-backed convenience methods, which are no longer useful in the overall context of
      JMockit APIs.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <strong><code>MockUp(T)</code></strong> constructor.
      (Use of this constructor causes the given instance of type <code>T</code> to be the only one affected by the
      fake implementations.)
      This feature was never intended for the faking API in the first place, it's been rarely used, and has no
      demonstrable use cases; existing tests that happen to use it should instead use real (non-faked) instances.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Renamed</strong> the "<code>mockups</code>" system property to "<code>fakes</code>".

<h3 id="1.33">Version <a href="#1.33">1.33</a> (Jun 25, 2017):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Additional enhancements to <code class="annotation">@Tested</code>:
      a) all available <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>'s having <em>subtypes</em> of target fields and/or
         constructor parameters are now considered for injection;
      b) previous <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> values from annotated fields or parameters are now eligible
         for injection into <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> objects, even without
         <code>fullyInitialized = true</code>.

<h3 id="1.32">Version <a href="#1.32">1.32</a> (May 28, 2017):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Enhancements to <code class="annotation">@Tested</code>:
      a) <em>field extraction</em> from a tested object into other <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> fields
         declared after it now works for any field in the source object (including primitive types, arrays, and
         collections), not only for injected dependencies;
      b) the annotation can now be used on test method parameters;
      c) new <code>value</code> attribute.

<h3 id="1.30">Version <a href="#1.30">1.30</a> (Dec 18, 2016):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped</strong> usage checks for the mocking and faking APIs.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>onInstance(mock)</code> method (deprecated in version 1.29 - see below) from
      the <code class="type">Expectations</code> and <code class="type">Verifications</code> classes.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>returns(Object)</code> method (deprecated in version 1.29 - see below) from
      the <code class="type">Expectations</code> class.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>Expectations(Integer, Object...)</code>,
      <code>StrictExpectations(Integer, Object...)</code>, <code>Verifications(int)</code>,
      <code>FullVerifications(int)</code>, <code>FullVerifications(Integer, Object...)</code>,

      <code>FullVerificationsInOrder(Integer, Object...)</code> constructors which take a
      "<code>numberOfIterations</code>" parameter.
      Iterated recording of expectations is a rarely used feature, and indicative of poor testing practices (when used).
      Existing tests which happen to use it should be reviewed or eliminated.

<h3 id="1.29">Version <a href="#1.29">1.29</a> (Oct 30, 2016):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the "<code>invocations</code>", "<code>minInvocations</code>", and
      "<code>maxInvocations</code>" attributes from the <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> annotation, which were
      deprecated in version 1.26.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <strong><code>onInstance(mock)</code></strong> method from classes
      <code class="type">Expectations</code> and <code class="type">Verifications</code>.
      Existing calls should be removed (leaving just "<code>mock</code>").
      Tests that need to match invocations to specific mocked instances should instead make use of
      <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> or of multiple <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>
      fields/parameters of the same type.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Changed</strong> the signature of the "<code>Expectations#returns(Object, Object...)</code>" method to
      just "<code>returns(Object)</code>", and <em>deprecated</em> it in favor of using the "<code>result</code>" field
      (for a single return value) or the newly added method "<code>returns(Object, Object, Object...)</code>" (for a

<h3 id="1.27">Version <a href="#1.27">1.27</a> (Aug 28, 2016):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the "<code>$</code>" field (deprecated in version 1.26) from
      <code class="type">Expectations</code> and <code class="type">Verifications</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added a validation against the application of mock-ups to classes that are <em>internal</em> to the codebase of

<h3 id="1.26">Version <a href="#1.26">1.26</a> (Jul 31, 2016):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>MockUp#tearDown()</code> method.
      Mock-up tear down is automatic, so explicit calls to this method are either made by mistake, or by misuse in
      tests that should be broken down into two or more test methods.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> all three attributes from the <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> annotation
      (<code>invocations</code>, <code>minInvocations</code>, and <code>maxInvocations</code>).
      Use of said attributes is indicative of a behavior-oriented test that would be better written with the
      Expectations API.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the "<code>$</code>" special field that can be used when recording or verifying
      expectations to provide a custom error message.
      This feature is of dubious value and probably never used.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped</strong> support for the <code>jmockit.properties</code> configuration file.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Added</strong> support for <strong>JUnit 5</strong> (the <code>5.0.0-M1</code> release of July 7).
      Differently from JUnit 4 support (and like TestNG support), the relative order in the classpath between JMockit
      and JUnit 5 dependencies is irrelevant - also, no configuration code needs to be added to a JUnit 5 test class
      in order to use the JMockit API, it just works.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added validations against redundant recordings which return the instance that would be returned through automatic
      cascading, and against the redundant or contradictory use of different mocking annotations on the same mock
      field/parameter.

<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: The code coverage tool now finds <em>redundant</em> tests, listing them in the
      HTML report.
      A test is deemed to be redundant when it does not cover any additional line segments or paths that haven't yet
      been covered by previous tests in the test run.
      Each such test can, in principle, be removed from the test suite without weakening it, provided some other test
      for the same scenario includes the assertions from the redundant test.<br/>
      This is (likely) the <em>first</em> practical coverage tool to make this feature available.

      <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code><code>(<strong>cascading = false</strong>)</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Conditionals and loops will now trigger an exception when found inside an

   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added support for the <code class="annotation">@Autowired</code> and
      <code class="annotation">@Value</code> annotations of the Spring DI framework.
      In addition, all annotated dependencies (using <code class="annotation">@Inject</code>,
      <code class="annotation">@Resource</code>, or <code class="annotation">@Autowired</code>) in a
      <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> object will now <em>require</em> a corresponding
      <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>; this is done for the following reasons: a) consistency with DI
      frameworks; b) preventing <code class="type">NullPointerExceptions</code>'s from uninitialized dependencies;
      c) encouraging cohesive classes with few dependencies; and d) encouraging the creation of at least one test for
      each injected dependency.

<h3 id="1.13">Version <a href="#1.13">1.13</a> (Oct 26, 2014):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Added</strong> the new class <em><code class="type">StrictExpectations</code></em> as a sibling to
      <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code>.
      The shared base class, <code class="type">Expectations</code>, no longer records <em>strict</em> expectations when
      used on its own; instead, its expectations are just like the ones from
      <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code>, but with a default minimum invocation count of <code>1</code>
      (one), as if recorded with a "<code>minTimes = 1</code>" constraint.
      This change in API semantics is meant to bring the following benefits:
      <ol>
         <li>
            More intuitive semantics when using the <code class="type">Expectations</code> class.
            New users usually don't expect "<code>new Expectations() {{ ... }}</code>" blocks to be strict, but they
            tend to expect such recorded expectations to require <em>at least one</em> matching invocation from the code
            under test.
         </li>
         <li>
            Recording of strict expectations will not occur by mistake anymore, as it will require the intentional
            selection of the explicitly-named <code class="type">StrictExpectations</code> subclass.
         </li>
         <li>
            Use of the longer-named <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> subclass will become much less
            common.
            Essentially, this subclass is now mostly useful in <em>test setup</em> methods only
            (<code class="annotation">@Before</code>, <code class="annotation">@BeforeMethod</code>), since such
            shared expectations will often not be used by <em>all</em> tests in the test class (hence they should be
            "<code>minTimes = 0</code>" by default).
         </li>
      </ol>
      Existing tests can continue to use <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> as before, but it's recommended
      to replace such uses with <code class="type">Expectations</code>, when they occur in test methods; when they
      occur in test <em>setup</em> methods, however, use of the non-strict subclass should be kept, unless one prefers
      to add an explicit "<code>minTimes = 0</code>" constraint to each recorded expectation.
      Tests that do want to record strict expectations, however, should change "<code>new Expectations...</code>" blocks
      to the equivalent "<code>new StrictExpectations...</code>" form.

<h3 id="1.12">Version <a href="#1.12">1.12</a> (Sep 21, 2014):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code class="annotation">@Cascading</code> annotation.
      Mocking now cascades by default on any mocked type, unless specified otherwise through the new
      <code>boolean</code> <strong><code>cascading</code></strong> attribute of <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>
      (which is <code>true</code> by default).<br/>
      This change may break existing tests if they require <code>null</code> to be returned, or if the return type of
      some method <em>must</em> not be mocked; in such cases, the test will have to be changed to either record a
      explicit <code>null</code> return, or to deactivate cascading.
   </li>
   <li>
      The annotations <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> and <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> can now be
      applied together to the same field.
      This causes the tested object to become <em>partially</em> mocked, as if it had been passed in a call to the
      <code>NonStrictExpectations(Object...)</code> constructor.
   </li>
   <li>
      The annotations <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> and <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> can also
      be applied together to the same field.
      Besides causing the tested object to be partially mocked, it can also get injected into another
      <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> field, if one exists having a suitable dependency.
      This ability can be used in integration tests where a top-level tested object has one or more second-level
      tested objects as dependencies.
   </li>
   <li>
      Improved the support for integration tests through
      <code class="annotation">@Tested(fullyInitialized = true)</code> fields, by properly handling injected fields of
      type <code class="type">javax.inject.Provider&lt;T></code>, and <em>servlet</em> classes (which extend
      <code class="type">javax.servlet.GenericServlet</code>, whose <code>init()</code> and <code>destroy()</code>
      methods get automatically called).
   </li>
   <li>
      New system property "<strong><code>coverage-maxCallPoints</code></strong>", to allow overriding the default value
      (10 call points per covered line of source code, in the HTML report).

<h3 id="1.11">Version <a href="#1.11">1.11</a> (Aug 24, 2014):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the methods <code>with(Object)</code> and <code>with(T, Object)</code> from base class
      <code class="type">mockit.Invocations</code> (shared by <code class="type">Expectations</code> and
      <code class="type">Verifications</code>), which were deprecated in release 1.9.<br/>
      As documented in the corresponding API deprecation comments, existing calls to these methods should be replaced
      with calls to <code>with(Delegate)</code> or <code>withArgThat(org.hamcrest.Matcher)</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Improved support for the IBM "J9" JRE (tested on version 7 of the SDK), to about the same level as the Oracle
      "HotSpot" JREs.
      The J9 JRE has a few limitations, however:
      1) <code>native</code> methods cannot be redefined and therefore are never mocked;
      2) JMockit initialization without the use of "-javaagent" only works if running in <em>debug</em> mode;
      3) the <code>java.lang.System</code> class cannot be reliably mocked.
   </li>
   <li>
      Upgraded the ASM library used internally to version 5.0.3.

<h3 id="1.10">Version <a href="#1.10">1.10</a> (Jul 27, 2014):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Migrated the project from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit">Google Code</a> to
      <a href="https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1">GitHub</a>.
      Project documentation is in a separate <a href="http://jmockit.github.io">"GitHub Pages" repository</a>.
      Previously reported issues remain in the Google Code issue tracker, while new ones should be reported in the
      <a href="https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the methods <code>Invocation#setMinInvocations(int)</code> and
      <code>Invocation#setMaxInvocations(int)</code>, which were deprecated in release 1.9.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added <code>MockUp(Object)</code> constructor and improved
      <code>MockUp#getMockInstance()</code> method to support mock-up behavior for exclusive instances of mocked
      classes.
      See API documentation for details.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added a "<code>fullyInitialized</code>" attribute to the
      <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> annotation, to recursively instantiate and inject all fields from the
      root tested object down to its deepest dependencies.
      Types with no <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> instances declared in the test class are resolved to
      their real, unmocked, implementations.
      This new ability is intended for <em>integration</em> tests, rather than unit tests.

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.9">Version <a href="#1.9">1.9</a> (Jun 22, 2014):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped</strong> support for the JUnit 3.8 <code class="type">TestCase</code> class.
      Existing tests using the JUnit 3.8 API should be converted to the JUnit 4 API, if they happen to use JMockit.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Improved the support for <em>Hamcrest</em> matchers by adding the method
      <code>withArgThat(org.hamcrest.Matcher)</code> to the <code class="type">Invocations</code> base class, while
      deprecating <code>with(Object)</code> and <code>with(T, Object)</code> (which already support Hamcrest by
      accepting <code>Matcher</code> objects).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the methods <code>Invocations#with(Object)</code> and
      <code>Invocations#with(T, Object)</code>.
      Existing calls to these methods should be replaced with calls to either <code>with(Delegate)</code> or
      <code>withArgThat(Matcher)</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>setMinInvocations(int)</code> and <code>setMaxInvocations(int)</code>
      methods of class <code class="type">Invocation</code>.
      Such methods are unlikely to be useful in real tests, and will be removed from the API in the next release,
      without any direct replacement.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>1.9</strong>; from now on the same version number of
      the mocking APIs will be used, for simplicity.
      <br/>
      Additional improvements:
      <ul>
         <li>
            The output mode originally called "<code>merge</code>" is now called "<code>serial-append</code>", for
            clarity.
         </li>
         <li>
            To facilitate deactivating the tool on a given test run, the system properties <code>coverage-classes</code>
            and <code>coverage-metrics</code> now also accept the value "<code>none</code>" (which previously was only
            accepted by the <code>coverage-output</code> property).
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: The Mockups API now supports AOP-style <em>advice</em>, in the form of a special
      "<code>Object $advice(Invocation)</code>" mock method.
   </li>
   <li>
      Issues fixed:
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=333">333</a>,

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.8">Version <a href="#1.8">1.8</a> (Apr 27, 2014):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      The <strong><a href="http://jmockit.org">jmockit.org</a></strong> domain now points to the JMockit project page.
      <br/>
      Also, the "<code>groupId</code>" for Maven artifacts has changed from "<code>com.googlecode.jmockit</code>" to
      "<code>org.jmockit</code>".
      Therefore, existing <code>pom.xml</code> files containing JMockit dependencies should be changed accordingly, for
      JMockit 1.8+ and JMockit Coverage 0.999.27+.
   </li>
   <li>
      From this version on, JMockit requires <strong>Java 6 or newer</strong> when running tests;
      JRE 1.5 is no longer supported.
      Note that this only applies to the JRE/JDK used for test execution; class files compiled for older versions of
      Java are still supported.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped support</strong> for <em>local</em> mock fields (declared inside expectation blocks), in favor of
      mock <em>parameters</em>.
      (Previous releases printed a warning to console output whenever a local mock field was found during a test run.)
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <strong><code class="annotation">@UsingMocksAndStubs</code></strong> annotation,
      which was deprecated in release 1.7.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the package <code>mockit.integration.logging</code> and its classes.
      They were deprecated in release 1.7.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>0.999.27</strong>.
      This version is compiled with Java 6 and will only run on JDK 1.6+.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: The <code class="type">MockUp&lt;T></code> class now has the ability to extend
      mocking to the classes implementing a specified interface, or to the subclasses of a specified base class.
      This is similar to what <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> provides in the Expectations API.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: The <code>List&ltT> withCapture(T)</code> method was added to the
      <code class="type">Verifications</code> class.
      When called with a constructor invocation, it allows new instances of a mocked class that were created by code
      under test with a matching constructor call to be captured to a list for verification.
   </li>
   <li>
      JMockit now works fine with the <a href="http://jacoco.org/jacoco/index.html">JaCoCo</a> code coverage tool,
      provided version 0.7.1 or newer of JaCoCo is used (an snapshot build of this version is currently available).
   </li>
   <li>
      JMockit now works fine with the <a href="http://robolectric.org">Robolectric</a> Android testing tool
      (tested with Robolectric 2.2 and 2.3).
   </li>
   <li>
      Issues fixed:
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=343">343</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=346">346</a>,

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.7">Version <a href="#1.7">1.7</a> (Mar 9, 2014):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped support</strong> for <em>non-annotated</em> mock fields and mock parameters.
      All such fields and test method parameters now need to use at least one of the four mocking annotations:
      <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>, <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>,
      <code class="annotation">@Cascading</code>, and/or <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code>.
      (Recent releases were already writing a warning to console output when a non-annotated mock field or mock
      parameter was found.)
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <strong><code>forEachInvocation</code></strong> field, which was deprecated in
      release 1.6.
      Existing tests using it should instead take advantage of the <code>withCapture()</code> and
      <code>withCapture(List)</code> methods, or convert the handler object to a <code class="type">Delegate</code>
      object assigned to the <code>result</code> field (in the case of a recorded expectation).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped support</strong> for importing local mock fields from expectation blocks into verification blocks,
      since it was a little known and rarely useful feature.
      Also, support for local mock fields is scheduled for removal in a future release (currently, the presence of local
      mock fields inside expectation blocks causes a warning to be printed).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code class="annotation">@UsingMocksAndStubs</code> annotation.
      Programmatic application of mock-ups at the test class or test suite levels should be done in
      <code class="annotation">@BeforeClass</code> methods instead (JUnit or TestNG).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the mock-up classes in the <code>mockit.integration.logging</code> package
      (<code class="type">Log4jMocks</code> and others).
      If they happen to be used in existing test classes, consider copying them into the client project or into an
      standalone jar file; future versions of JMockit will no longer include them.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped support</strong> for the <strong><code>jmockit-stubs</code></strong> system property.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: JMockit Coverage (updated to version <strong>0.999.26</strong>) will consider only
      classes loaded during the test run, if the "<code>coverage-classes</code>" system property is set to
      "<code>loaded</code>".
      This is useful when running a set of tests targeting only a small part of the codebase, so that the generated
      HTML report only includes the classes of interest.
   </li>
   <li>

</ul>

<h3 id="1.6">Version <a href="#1.6">1.6</a> (Dec 23, 2013):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code> annotation, which was deprecated in
      release 1.5.
      Tests still using it should instead use <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> blocks.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the "<code>methods</code>" and "<code>inverse</code>" attributes of the
      <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> annotation, which were deprecated in release 1.5.
      Tests still using "<code>@Mocked(methods = {...})</code> should instead use the default "<code>value</code>"
      attribute.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Expectations#returns(Object)</code> method, in favor of using the
      <code>result</code> field instead.
      The <code class="type">Expectations</code> class still contains the <code>returns(Object, Object...)</code>
      method, however.
      Therefore, existing "<code>returns(&lt;a value>);</code>" calls will automatically become calls to the "varargs"
      method, provided test classes are recompiled; if they are not, a <code class="type">NoSuchMethodError</code> will
      occur whenever the removed <code>returns(Object)</code> method is called.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> all Reflection-based utility methods from the <code class="type">Invocations</code> class
      (the base for <code class="type">Expectations</code> and <code class="type">Verifications</code>), in favor of
      using the <code>static</code> methods of identical signatures in the <code class="type">Deencapsulation</code>
      class.
      This change in the API will not require any changes to test code, except that test classes using these methods
      should now include the following "static import":
      <code>import static mockit.Deencapsulation.*;</code>
   </li>
   <li>
      The special fields used in <code class="type">Expectations</code> and <code class="type">Verifications</code>
      blocks (<code>anyInt</code>, <code>result</code>, etc.) have been changed from <code>static</code> to
      <em>instance</em> fields.
      This change should require nothing more than a recompilation of existing test classes.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>forEachInvocation</code> field.
      Existing tests using it should instead take advantage of the new <code>withCapture()</code> and
      <code>withCapture(List)</code> argument-capturing methods, which provide better syntax.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>0.999.25</strong>, with some fixes and performance
      improvements.
   </li>
   <li>
      Issues fixed:

</ul>

<h3 id="1.5">Version <a href="#1.5">1.5</a> (Oct 20, 2013):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>reentrant</code> attribute of the <code class="annotation">@Mock</code>
      annotation, which was deprecated in release 1.1.
      Existing mock methods marked as reentrant should instead have an <code class="type">Invocation</code> parameter.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Dropped</strong> support for the "<code>it</code>" field.
      Mock classes which have an <code>it</code> field should instead use the
      <code>Invocation#getInvokedInstance()</code> method in order to obtain the invoked instance of the mocked class.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.setUpMocks(Object...)</code> and
      <code>Mockit.setUpMock(Object)</code> methods, which were deprecated in release 1.1.
      These were the last methods in the <code class="type">Mockit</code> class, so it was removed as well.
      Existing tests still using any of these methods should replace them as described in the corresponding API
      deprecation comments.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code class="annotation">@MockClass</code> annotation, which was deprecated in
      release 1.1.
      Existing mock classes should instead extend the <code class="type">MockUp&lt;T></code> base class.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code> annotation.
      Existing tests using it should instead use <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>, while converting
      "<code>new <strong>Expectations</strong>() { ... }</code>" blocks to
      "<code>new <strong>NonStrictExpectations</strong>() { ... }</code>" blocks.
      Alternatively, if strict recording is desired for some other mocked type, the expectations recorded on the
      <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code> mocked type can be moved to a separate non-strict expectations block.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the "<code>methods</code>" and "<code>inverse</code>" attributes of
      <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>.
      Existing uses like <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code><code>(methods = {"method1", "method2"})</code> should
      simply be rewritten as <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code><code>({"method1", "method2"})</code> (using the
      default <code>value</code> attribute).
      As for the <code>inverse</code> attribute, specify what <em>is</em> to be mocked instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>0.999.24</strong>, with a minor fix for Unix/Linux
      systems (see issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=305">305</a>), and an enhancement:
      configuration properties such as "<code>jmockit-coverage-metrics=line"</code> can now be written without the
      <code>"jmockit-"</code> prefix as well.

<h3 id="1.4">Version <a href="#1.4">1.4</a> (Aug 21, 2013):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.stubOut(...)</code> and <code>Mockit.stubOutClass(...)</code> methods,
      which were deprecated in release 1.1.
      To replace existing calls, use the <code class="type">MockUp</code> class.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>classNames</code> and <code>inverse</code> attributes of the
      <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> annotation, which were deprecated in release 1.3.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>realClassName</code> attribute of the <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>
      annotation, which was deprecated in release 1.3.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the two methods <code>Mockit.setUpMock(Class realClass, Object mock)</code> and
      <code>Mockit.setUpMock(Class realClass, Class mockClass)</code>, which were deprecated in release 1.1.
      The <code class="type">MockUp</code> class should be used to replace existing calls to these methods.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>0.999.23</strong>, with small fixes and enhancements.

   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1.3">Version <a href="#1.3">1.3</a> (Jun 23, 2013):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code class="annotation">@Input</code> annotation, which had been deprecated in
      release 1.2.
      Existing tests with <code class="annotation">@Input</code> fields will have to record equivalent expectations
      instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Expectations#notStrict()</code> method, which had been deprecated in release
      1.2.
      Existing tests that call this method will have to use <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code> or
      <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> instead, with the associated verification block.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.setUpMock(String realClassName, Object mock)</code> and
      <code>Mockit.setUpMock(String realClassName, Class<?> mockClass)</code> methods, which were deprecated in release
      1.1.
      To replace existing calls, use Reflection to load the non-accessible real class, then pass it in a call to
      <code>MockUp(Class)</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.stubOutClass(String realClassName, String... filters)</code> and
      <code>Mockit.stubOutClass(String realClassName, boolean inverse, String... filters)</code> methods, which were
      deprecated in release 1.1.
      To replace existing calls, use Reflection to load the non-accessible real class, then pass it in a call to
      <code>MockUp(Class)</code>; methods to be stubbed out should have empty <code class="annotation">@Mock</code>
      methods in the mock-up class.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.setUpMocksAndStubs(Class... mockAndRealClasses)</code> method, which
      was deprecated in release 1.1.
      Use <code class="annotation">@UsingMocksAndStubs</code> on the test class instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.setUpStartupMocks(Object... mockClassesOrInstances)</code> method, which
      was deprecated in release 1.1.
      Set the <code>jmockit-mocks</code> system property instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <strong><code>classNames</code></strong> and <strong><code>inverse</code></strong>
      attributes of the <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> annotation, and the
      <strong><code>realClassName</code></strong> attribute of the <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> annotation.
      These annotation attributes are rarely useful and not refactoring-friendly; they are scheduled to be removed in a
      future release.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>0.999.22</strong>, with an enhancement:
      Added the <strong><code>jmockit-coverage-maxConditions</code></strong> system property, to limit the maximum
      complexity of methods for the <em>path coverage</em> metric.
      The default value for this property is 10 (ten).
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=300">300</a>.

</ul>

<h3 id="1.2">Version <a href="#1.2">1.2</a> (Apr 21, 2013):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code class="type">Instantiation</code> enum, which had been deprecated in release
      1.1.<br/>
      Existing mock classes using the
      <code><span class="annotation">MockClass</span>#<strong>instantiation</strong></code> annotation attribute will
      need to be converted to <code class="type">MockUp&lt;T></code> subclasses.
      In the case of "<code>instantiation = <strong>PerMockSetup</strong></code>", simply convert the mock class to a
      mock-up class, which always uses a single instance per setup.
      The "<code>instantiation = <strong>PerMockedInstance</strong></code>" functionality is no longer available, since
      it was rarely used and can be emulated with a <code>Map</code> in a single mock-up class instance, for any state
      associated to individual mocked instances.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.<strong>tearDownMocks()</strong></code> and
      <code>Mockit.<strong>tearDownMocks(Class<?>...)</strong></code> methods, which were deprecated in release 1.1.
      <br/>
      Existing calls to these methods will need to be either removed or replaced with calls to
      <code>MockUp#tearDown()</code>.
      The first choice (simply removing existing calls) should be applicable in most or all cases, since JMockit
      automatically tears down all mock classes applied on a given context, when said context (the test method/class/
      suite or a test preceded by a "before" method) is exited.
      If explicit tear down really is needed, then the <code class="type">MockUp</code> class and its
      <code>tearDown()</code> method will have to be used instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>Mockit.<strong>newEmptyProxy(...)</strong></code> methods, deprecated in
      release 1.1.
      Use "<code>new MockUp&lt;E>(){}.getMockInstance()</code>" instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code class="annotation">@Input</code> annotation.
      Few, if any, users seem to have ever used this small part of the mocking API.
      Its use was entirely optional, since what it does can always be achieved with the
      <code>result</code> field; it was merely meant as a more succinct alternative in simple scenarios, where a given
      mocked type would have a single mocked method which needed to return a value of a certain type, or throw a
      certain checked exception.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>Expectations#notStrict()</code> method.
      This is a rarely used method, which can always be replaced by recording non-strict expectations and adding
      verification blocks.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: The "<code>result</code>" field now can perform additional type conversions,
      including primitive <em>widening</em> conversions such as from <code>char</code> to <code>int</code>.
      Also supported are primitive <em>narrowing</em> conversions, for example from <code>int</code> to
      <code>byte</code>.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=285">285</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>0.999.21</strong>, with an enhancement:
      The code coverage tool can now be used without <code>jmockit.jar</code> or <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code> in
      the classpath.
      Instead, the JVM should be launched with the "<code>-javaagent:&lt;proper path>jmockit-coverage.jar</code>"
      initialization parameter.
   </li>

</ul>

<h3 id="1.1">Version <a href="#1.1">1.1</a> (Feb 25, 2013):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> parts of the Mockups API:
      the <code class="annotation">@MockClass</code> annotation, the <code class="type">Instantiation</code> enum, the
      <code>reentrant</code> attribute in the <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> annotation, and all methods in the
      <code class="type">Mockit</code> class.
      See the corresponding deprecation comments in API documentation for ways to replace existing uses of these API
      elements.<br/>
      As replacement for the "<code>Mockit.tearDownMocks(...)</code>" methods, the <code>tearDown()</code> method was
      added to the <code class="type">MockUp</code> class.

   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> updated to version <strong>0.999.20</strong>, with the following issues fixed:

<h3 id="0.999.19">Version <a href="#0.999.19">0.999.19</a> (Nov 19, 2012):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added support for test execution in the presence of custom class loaders, such
      as Maven's <code class="type">IsolatedClassLoader</code> (which gets used when certain Surefire configuration
      parameters such as "<code>&lt;useSystemClassLoader>false&lt;/useSystemClassLoader></code>" are specified).
      Fixes issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=247">247</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added support for automatic conversions when a single value is assigned to the
      <code>result</code> field, but the return type of the recorded method is an array, collection, or iterator.
      In these cases, a suitable container object is created with that single value.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: When verifying expectations, "<code>aLocalVar = withCapture()</code>" expressions
      will now consider the type of the local variable into which the argument is captured when looking for matching
      invocations. This is useful for parameters of reference types, when the actual arguments received during replay
      are of a subtype; such arguments can be captured by using a capturing variable of that subtype.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added an <strong><code>unverifiedInvocations()</code></strong> method to
      <code class="type">FullVerifications</code>, to allow a test to discard unverified invocations occurring in an
      early preparation phase, while allowing later invocations to be verified as needed.
      This is similar to "<code>reset(mock)</code>" methods provided in other mocking APIs.
      Fixes issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=257">257</a>.
   </li>

<h3 id="0.999.18">Version <a href="#0.999.18">0.999.18</a> (Oct 18, 2012):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added support for specifying "replacement instances" through the <code>result</code>
      field. When recording a <em>constructor</em> expectation, simply assign an instance of the mocked class to have
      it "take the place" of any new instances that get later created with a matching constructor invocation.
      The replacement instance can be obtained from a mock field/parameter, or be a <em>real</em> instance when applying
      dynamic mocking through a "new <code>Expectations(AClassToBeMocked.class)</code>" or
      "new <code>NonStrictExpectations(AClassToBeMocked.class)</code>" call.
      This solves <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=210">issue 210</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> can now be applied to <code>abstract</code>
      classes. A subclass is created with all abstract methods automatically mocked, so that expectations can be
      recorded and verified on them.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added automatic conversions from arrays assigned to the <code>result</code> field,
      when recording return values for a method whose return type is a collection, iterator, or map.
      This provides a convenient way to specify static values for such methods, since it's easier to fill out an array
      than a <code class="type">List</code> or <code class="type">Map</code>.
      Additionally, automatic conversions from strings to <code class="type">StringBuilder</code>,
      <code class="type">InputStream</code>, <code class="type">ByteArrayInputStream</code>,
      <code class="type">Reader</code>, <code class="type">StringReader</code>, and
      <code class="type">java.nio.CharBuffer</code> are now also supported.

</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.17">Version <a href="#0.999.17">0.999.17</a> (Sep 17, 2012):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: When using <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> and
      <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, use of the
      <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/package-summary.html">standard Java API for dependency
      injection</a> (JSR-330) in the tested class is now explicitly supported.
      Any fields and/or constructors annotated with <code class="type">javax.inject.Inject</code> will be the only ones
      considered when performing injection of <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>s into the
      <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> object.
      Also, the <code class="type">javax.inject.Provider&lt;T></code> interface is properly supported for
      <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>s of type "<code>T</code>".
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>:
      Added the <a href="javadoc/mockit/Verifications.html#withCapture()"><code>withCapture()</code></a> and
      <a href="javadoc/mockit/Verifications.html#withCapture(java.util.List)"><code>withCapture(List)</code></a> methods
      to the <code class="type">Verifications</code> base class (the second one also available in
      <code class="type">Expectations</code> blocks).
      These two new methods allow for the easy and succinct capture of invocation arguments for recorded/verified
      expectations.
      For details and an example, see the API documentation.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong> in JMockit Coverage:
      A new property "<code>jmockit-coverage-check</code>" is now supported, enabling checks for minimum coverage
      percentages to be performed.
      For details, see the <a href="tutorial/CodeCoverage.html#checking">relevant</a> section in the JMockit Tutorial.
      This solves <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=235">issue 235</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>:
      Added the <a href="javadoc/mockit/Invocation.html#getInvokedArguments()"><code>getInvokedArguments()</code></a>
      method to the <code class="type">Invocation</code> class.
      Together with a related enhancement which allows "<code>forEachInvocation</code>" handler methods to only have the
      <code class="type">Invocation</code> parameter, this further enables the creation of reusable delegate and handler
      objects for use with the <code class="type">Delegate</code> interface and the <code>result</code> and
      <code>forEachInvocation</code> fields.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Dropped the requirement for a <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> class to have
      an accessible constructor.
      This helps in the case where a public class is only meant to be instantiated by a DI container, allowing it to
      have non-public constructors only.
   </li>
   <li>
      Other issues fixed:
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=187">187</a>,

<h3 id="0.999.16">Version <a href="#0.999.16">0.999.16</a> (Jul 30, 2012):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> methods now also apply to the super-classes of
      the specified class to be mocked, when the latter doesn't define a matching method.
      This avoids the need to set up two or more separate mock classes when the methods to be method are defined in
      multiple levels of a class hierarchy.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Mock-ups for generic classes now can declare mock methods with parameters types
      matching the generic argument types specified in the mocked type, instead of using <code>Object</code>.
      This is still not supported when the mocked type is a generic interface, however.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=229">issue 229</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Previously, when a <code class="type">Delegate</code> method invoked another mocked
      method/constructor, it would cause the real implementation of that method/constructor to be executed; now such an
      invocation gets the mocked behavior, which is what a user would intuitively expect.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>: Removed the <code>jmockit-coverage-{htmlbasic|htmlfull|serial|merge}.jar</code>
      files from the distribution zip file, and dropped support for output selection through the addition of such files
      to the runtime classpath.
      This was done because few users relied on this feature, and it wasn't applicable to Maven runs; also, some users
      add every jar file to the classpath by default.
      Therefore, the only way now to select the desired coverage output is by setting the
      <code>jmockit-coverage-output</code> system property.
   </li>
   <li>
      Automatic JMockit initialization is now supported on <strong>Mac OS X</strong>.
      (Previously, it was usually necessary to add the "<code>-javaagent</code>" parameter when using JDK 1.6+ on this
      OS.)
   </li>
   <li>
      Added support for the new "<code>jmockit-mockParameters=annotated</code>" system property, to be set when
      automatic (non-annotated) mock parameters in test methods would conflict with some other JUnit/TestNG integration.
      When set, only those test method parameters that are explicitly annotated with
      <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>, <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code>,
      <code class="annotation">@Cascading</code>, <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code>, and/or
      <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> are considered to be <em>mock</em> parameters.

<h3 id="0.999.15">Version <a href="#0.999.15">0.999.15</a> (Apr 30, 2012):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: Added the <code>proceed()</code> method to
      <code class="type">mockit.Invocation</code>, to be used in <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> or delegate
      methods.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: When running JMockit Coverage in standalone mode, the classes to be measured for
      coverage will now be those not loaded from a jar file, unless specified otherwise.
      (In a web application running inside a Java application server, for example, these will be the classes under
      <code>WEB-INF/classes</code>.)
   </li>
   <li>
      Issues fixed:
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=220">220</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=221">221</a>.
      <br/>
      Also, applied a temporary workaround to avoid a NPE during path building (JMockit Coverage).
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.14">Version <a href="#0.999.14">0.999.14</a> (Mar 30, 2012):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>:
      The JMockit Coverage tool can now be used in "standalone" mode, outside of a test run.
      To enable this mode in any JVM instance, simply start it with
      "<code>-javaagent:&lt;proper path>/jmockit-coverage.jar</code>";
      there is no need to add any jar to any classpath.
      <br/>
      With the Tomcat application server, for example, one can set the "<code>CATALINA_OPTS</code>" environment
      variable with a value like
      "<code>-javaagent:/jmockit/jmockit-coverage.jar -Djmockit-coverage-outputDir=/dir/for/coverage/report</code>"
      (as shown here, "jmockit-coverage-" system properties can optionally be set as well).
      <br/>
      Standalone mode provides a JMX "MBean" for control, which can be accessed locally or remotely through a JMX
      client such as JConsole (available in the JDK).
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed inadequacies in the errors automatically thrown when <em>unexpected</em> or <em>missing</em>
      invocations were detected during a test; instead of throwing a <code>java.lang.AssertionError</code>, JMockit will
      now throw a custom <code>java.lang.Error</code> subclass -
      see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=213">issue 213</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added a validation against mixing strict and non-strict expectations for the same dynamically mocked instance or
      class (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=209">issue 209</a>);
      changed the precedence when choosing whether to mock strictly or non-strictly in favor of the latter, in
      situations where the same type is mocked twice.
   </li>
   <li>
      Removed the automatic activation of asserts in test classes, since it only worked when using
      <code>-javaagent:jmockit.jar</code>, among other reasons.
   </li>
   <li>
      Other issues fixed:
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=211">211</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=214">214</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      The following experimental/incomplete tools are no longer included in the distribution zip file:
      <em>Hibernate 3 Emulation</em> (<code>jmockit-hibernate3emul.jar</code>), <em>Incremental Test Runner</em>
      (<code>jmockit-incremental.jar</code>), and <em>Multicore Test Runner</em> (<code>jmockit-multicore.jar</code>).
      The development of these tools will be eventually completed, as part of the
      <a href="http://jmockit.org2">JMockit 2</a> project.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.13">Version <a href="#0.999.13">0.999.13</a> (Feb 23, 2012):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the "<code>Mocked#capture</code>" and "<code>Capturing#baseType</code>" annotation
      attributes, which were deprecated in the previous release.
      Existing tests still using them will have to be changed as described in the deprecation comments.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: Added the "<code>value</code>" attribute to
      <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, to enable the injection of primitive values and strings into
      "<code class="annotation">@Tested</code>" objects from mock <em>parameters</em> (previously, it was only possible
      with mock <em>fields</em>).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancements</strong> to the automatic instantiation and injection of
      <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> objects:
      a) constructor injection now selects among multiple constructors when more than one can be satisfied by the
      available <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>'s, by choosing the one with the most parameters;
      b) for constructor injection, the <em>names</em> of eligible constructors are now matched against the names of
      the injectable fields <em>and</em> test method parameters having the same type as the constructor parameter;
      c) the names of injectable parameters, as declared in test methods, are considered when searching for matching
      constructor parameters and instance fields in the tested class;
      d) <em>field</em> injection is now always performed, even if constructor injection was not (ie, the tested class
      was explicitly instantiated).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: "<code>forEachInvocation</code>" validation methods can now return
      <code>boolean</code> to indicate whether the received invocation arguments are valid (<code>true</code>) or not
      (<code>false</code>).
      In the last case, a descriptive error message is generated from the validation method name and the actual argument
      values.
      <br/>
      This change will break existing tests which use a <em><code>forEachInvocation</code></em> class whose method
      happens to return a value to be returned from the associated recorded expectation.
      Instead, an identical <code class="type">Delegate</code> object should be assigned to the
      <em><code>result</code></em> field.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>: Several fixes and enhancements to the HTML report.
      Fixed an issue with code compiled with Java 7.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> an incompatibility with TestNG introduced in the previous release.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=194">194</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a bug affecting the recording of multi-valued (arrays, collections, etc.) return values
      for methods whose return type is also a multi-valued type.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=196">196</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Other bug fixes</strong>: a) improper instance-specific matching of invocations to constructors (now the
      new instance is never matched); b) use of <code>onInstance(mock)</code> in verification blocks didn't work when
      multiple instances of the mocked type were involved; c) dynamically mocked constructors could not invoke private
      methods.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.12">Version <a href="#0.999.12">0.999.12</a> (Dec 22, 2011):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the "<code>capture</code>" and "<code>baseType</code>" annotation attributes, used in
      the <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> and <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> annotations,
      respectively.
      Existing uses of "<code>@Mocked(<strong>capture</strong> = <em>n</em>)</code>" should be replaced with
      "<code>@Capturing</code>" or "<code>@Capturing(maxInstances = <em>n</em>)</code>", as needed.
      Applications of "<code>@Capturing(<strong>baseType</strong> = <em>BaseType.class</em>)</code>" to a test class
      should be replaced with "<code>@Capturing <em>BaseType</em> xyz;</code>" mock fields.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: mock classes and classes to be stubbed out for a whole test suite can now be
      specified through external configuration, by defining the "<code>jmockit-mocks</code>" and
      "<code>jmockit-stubs</code>" system properties, respectively.
      These properties can also be defined in custom <code>jmockit.properties</code> files, which may appear in the
      classpath in any number; if more than one such file defines one of those properties, the values are added
      together.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Error messages for unexpected or missing invocations will now include the actual
      <em>parameter names</em> of mocked methods/constructors.
      Other small improvements were also made in the failure descriptions generated by argument matchers.
   </li>
   <li>
      Internal classes copied from <strong>Hamcrest 1.1</strong> (under <code>mockit.external.hamcrest</code>) were
      replaced with new code, for reasons of simplicity and efficiency.
      At the same time, the <code>with(Delegate&lt;T>)</code> method was improved to return a non-<code>null</code>
      default value when <code>T</code> is a primitive wrapper type.
   </li>
   <li>
      Completed the internal upgrade to <strong>ASM 4</strong> (under <code>mockit.external.asm4</code>), which began a
      few releases ago.
   </li>
   <li>
      New <strong>"Faking x Mocking" sample test suite</strong> created, based on
      <a href="http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/JMockIt.AStoryAboutTooMuchPower">this</a> article.
      This is the only test suite which contains both <em>unit</em> and <em>integration</em> tests.
      Integration test classes are named as <code>"...IntegrationTest"</code> so they can be executed separately.
      In addition to that, the integration tests can be executed in two different "modes": as pure integration tests
      accessing an external Web site, or with <em>faked</em> network access simulating the responses from the Web site.
   </li>
   <li>
      Upgraded existing comparison test suites to use <strong>Mockito 1.9.0</strong> and
      <strong>Unitils Mock 3.2</strong>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong> received a few fixes and improvements to the <em>path coverage</em> metric:
      1) <em>stack map frames</em> in the bytecode generated by a Java 7 compiler are now handled correctly, avoiding
      the <code>VerifyError</code> that could occur before;
      2) <code>break</code> statements inside loops are now handled properly (there is still an issue with
      <code>continue</code> statements, though);
      3) certain simple constructs such as <code>return !b; // (b == a boolean)</code> caused an unexpected path to be
      detected and measured, which is now disregarded.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a problem in tests using the Expectations API, where the same class was mocked in an outer
      scope (as a mock field in the test class, usually) <em>and</em> in an inner scope (as a mock parameter or a
      dynamic mock in a test method).
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=189">189</a>.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.11">Version <a href="#0.999.11">0.999.11</a> (Oct 21, 2011):</h3>
<p>
   From this version on, JMockit artifacts are deployed to the <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2">Maven Central</a>
   repository, under a different "<code>&lt;groupId></code>" of "<code>com.googlecode.jmockit</code>".
   Therefore, Maven users should change JMockit dependencies in their <code>pom.xml</code> files accordingly.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Changed</strong> the semantics for the <code>Expectations(Object...)</code> and
      <code>NonStrictExpectations(Object...)</code> constructors so that the <code class="type">Class</code> literals
      and/or instances passed in are (<em>dynamically</em>) mocked in a more intuitive way:
      a) for a given <code class="type">Class</code>, the super-classes are now also considered for mocking, rather than
      only the specified class;
      b) for a given <em>object</em>, only method invocations made on the specified instance will be able to match
      expectations (invocations on other instances will execute the real implementation).
      <br/>
      Most existing tests which use dynamic partial mocking should not be affected, but there is the possibility that a
      few may break, requiring adaptation to the new behavior.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added support for the new <em>automatic listener registration</em> feature of <strong>TestNG 6.2</strong>.
      With this, it is no longer necessary to explicitly specify the
      <code class="type">mockit.integration.testng.Initializer</code> listener.
      When running on Java 6+ with TestNG 6.2+, the listener will be automatically registered.
      (The use of <code>-javaagent:jmockit.jar</code> is still required with Java 5, though.)
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in the JMockit-TestNG integration which caused <em>"Invalid context for the recording
      of expectations"</em> failures.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> bugs affecting <code class="annotation">@Cascading</code> mock fields declared in test
      classes, where cascaded instances created during the execution of a test would remain in effect for a different
      test class, or would not be recreated for a second test in the same test class.
      See issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=182">182</a> and
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=185">185</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a couple of bugs of omission in the Reflection-based utility methods used for calling
      inaccessible methods and constructors:
      a) when there were multiple matching methods/constructors, the first one to be found was used, rather than the one
      with the most specific parameters;
      b) only constructors with the exact same parameters as the actual argument types were found, rather than
      constructors with <em>compatible</em> parameters (as already done for methods).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>: Fixed a problem with nested classes that get loaded before the outer class.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.10">Version <a href="#0.999.10">0.999.10</a> (Jun 16, 2011):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Renamed</strong> the "<strong>Annotations</strong>" API, since most annotations now belong to the much
      grown Expectations API. It is now known as the "<strong>Mockups</strong>" API.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhanced</strong> the support for <strong><code class="annotation">@Tested</code></strong> fields:
      1) <em>non-public</em> classes with a package-private constructor are now accepted as well;
      2) <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> fields of <em>non-mockable</em> types (primitives and arrays) are
      now considered when injecting values into the tested object;
      3) <em>multiple</em> parameters of the same type are now supported when doing constructor injection, by taking
      values from matching injectable fields declared in the same relative order;
      4) a <em>varargs</em> constructor parameter is now supported, taking the values of all injectable fields having
      the same type.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhanced</strong> the support for <strong><code class="annotation">@Input</code></strong> fields:
      1) <em>multiple</em> fields of the same type can be declared, allowing <em>consecutive</em> results to be
      specified;
      2) the new <strong><code>invocations = <em>n</em></code></strong> attribute can be used to specify a fixed number
      of matching invocations for a given input field;
      3) auto-instantiation of values can now be done with a <em>non-public</em> no-args constructor;
      4) it now also works when combined with <em>dynamic</em> partial mocking.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: The <code class="type">mockit.Invocation</code> class can now be used as the type of
      the first parameter in <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> methods (it was already supported in delegate and
      validation methods).
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=16">16</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Some fixes and improvements to the <strong>TestNG</strong> and <strong>JUnit 3.8</strong> integrations.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=167">167</a> for one of the bugs fixed.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed/improved</strong> the handling of non-strict expectations recorded for the same method, when using
      similar or equivalent argument matchers.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=168">168</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Reviewed the Tutorial chapter on <a href="tutorial/BehaviorBasedTesting.html">behavior-based testing</a>,
      with new coverage on the <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> and <code class="annotation">@Tested</code>
      annotations.
   </li>
   <li>Tested and adapted JMockit to run on <strong>JDK 7</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.9">Version <a href="#0.999.9">0.999.9</a> (May 17, 2011):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: expectation blocks can now specify <em>default results</em> for mocked
      methods/constructors, without specifying anything but the return type (for default return values) or a checked
      exception from the <code>throws</code> clause.
      Each default result is specified through an instance field annotated with
      <strong><code class="annotation">@Input</code></strong>.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/source/browse/trunk/samples/tutorial/test/jmockit/tutorial/
domain/MyBusinessService_ExpectationsAPI2_Test.java">here</a> for examples.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixes and improvements to the support for <strong>reusable expectation/verification blocks</strong> and base test
      classes.
      A reusable base class which extends (directly or indirectly) <code class="type">Expectations</code> or
      <code class="type">Verifications</code> must have a name ending in "Expectations" or "Verifications",
      respectively.
      Any such classes in existing test suites will have to be renamed if needed to fit this new rule.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=161">161</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong> and <em>potentially breaking change</em>:
      A <em>duplicate</em> recording of a non-strict expectation will now override the previously recorded expectation.
      Note that this also improves the ability to reuse expectations, since those recorded in a "before" method can now
      be overridden by identical expectations recorded in a test method.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=155">155</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: added the <strong><code>verifiedInvocations(Verifications)</code></strong> method to
      the <code class="type">VerificationsInOrder</code> class.
      With this, new scenarios involving <em>partially ordered verification</em> are now supported.
      See issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=153">153</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <strong><code>endRecording()</code></strong> method of the
      <code class="type">Expectations</code> class.
      This method was deprecated in the previous release. Existing tests still using it will have to be changed as
      described in the deprecation comment.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>TestNG integration</strong> no longer requires the <code>mockit.integration.testng.Initializer</code>
      listener to be configured, <em>as long as</em> the "<code>-javaagent:jmockit.jar</code>" JVM parameter is
      specified. Otherwise, the listener is still needed.
   </li>
   <li>
      Other issues fixed:
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=156">156</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=157">157</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=160">160</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=163">163</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=164">164</a>.
      Also, handled a situation where a <code>ClassFormatError</code> would occur in classes instrumented by the
      EMMA code coverage tool, when they were mocked with <em>reentrant</em> mock methods (Annotations API).
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.8">Version <a href="#0.999.8">0.999.8</a> (March 11, 2011):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Dropped support for <em>mock constructors</em> in the <strong>Annotations API</strong>, to avoid confusion and
      simplify the documentation.
      Constructors in a target class can still be mocked with mock methods named "<code>$init</code>"
      (which already was the recommended way).
      Therefore, any mock classes containing constructors annotated with <code>@Mock</code> must be changed to use
      <code>void $init</code> methods instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the <strong><code>endRecording()</code></strong> method of the
      <code>Expectations</code> class.
      Normally, this method would only be used in rare situations, and with <em>local</em> mock fields.
      Any such tests should be changed to make use of <em>mock parameters</em> or mock fields of the test class instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: When generating an error message for unexpected or missing invocations, custom
      <code>toString()</code> methods on non-mocked arguments will always be called to provide a more useful/readable
      message.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=146">issue 146</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: in tests containing two or more <em>verification blocks</em>, an expectation
      verified in a given block won't need to be repeated in a later <em>full</em> verification block.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=137">issue 137</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where an unordered verification block specifying a fixed number of iterations would
      fail to catch an unexpected invocation.
   </li>
   <li>
      Implemented workarounds for issues caused by the lack of required debug information in classes instrumented by the
      <strong>EMMA/EclEmma</strong> tool.
      See issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=141">135</a> and
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=141">141</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>: Fixed a couple of bugs which caused failures in specific situations
      (one only affected classes compiled without debug information; the other only affected classes containing uses of
      nested classes defined in <em>other</em> classes).
      See issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=138">138</a> and
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=142">142</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a few other small bugs.
      See issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=143">143</a>,

<h3 id="0.999.7">Version <a href="#0.999.7">0.999.7</a> (February 13, 2011):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: Created the <strong><code>@Tested</code></strong> annotation for tested classes,
      with support for <em>constructor</em> and <em>field</em> injection of <code>@Injectable</code> mocks.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Breaking API change</strong>: The default value for the
      <strong><code>stubOutClassInitialization</code></strong> attribute of the <code>@Mocked</code> annotation is now
      <strong><code>false</code></strong>.
      The <code>jmockit-retainStaticInitializers</code> system property is no longer supported, given that in practice
      it was only used to change the global default for that attribute to <code>false</code>.
      This change can break existing tests which happened to mock a class containing static initialization code, when
      such code performed operations that could potentially fail in the test environment (such as connecting to a remote
      database, for example).
      In such a case, the <code>@Mocked(stubOutClassInitialization = true)</code> annotation will have to be applied to
      the appropriate mock field/parameter.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Changed</strong> the treatment for expectations recorded on overridden <code>equals</code>,
      <code>hashCode</code> and <code>toString</code> methods so they are always considered <em>non-strict</em>, even
      when the recording is done on an otherwise <em>strict</em> mocked instance.
      This allows such methods to be invoked freely while still having strict verification of expected/unexpected
      invocations on a strict mock.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: The <code>result</code> field and the <code>returns(Object)</code> method (both
      available in expectation blocks) now also accept <em>arrays</em> and <code>Iterable</code>'s containing values to
      be returned by consecutive invocations (<em>collections</em> and <em>iterators</em> were already supported).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Fixed robustness issues when recording expectations in "before" methods, or when
      verifying expectations in "after" methods.
      If any mock classes are set up in a "before"/setUp method, they will now be torn down automatically at the end of
      the test (previously, this required a call to <code>Mockit.tearDownMocks(...)</code> in an "after"/tearDown
      method.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added support for the definition of <em>system properties</em> in a custom
      <code>jmockit.properties</code> file.
      (The default version of this file can be found inside <code>jmockit.jar</code>.)
      Several tools in the JMockit toolkit allow configuration through "jmockit-xyz" system properties, which previously
      had to be defined with the "-D" JVM parameter (or the equivalent Ant/Maven XML code).
      Now such properties can also be defined by adding a <code>[jmockit-]xyz=some value</code> line in the custom
      properties file, which should be added to the classpath <em>before</em> <code>jmockit.jar</code> in order to
      override it. The "jmockit-" prefix is optional when using the file, but will be added in the actual system
      property so that tools can always look for "jmockit-xyz" properties.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a bug which prevented <em>non-strict</em> invocations from being properly matched during
      replay, when <em>capturing</em> internally created instances for two or more mock fields (or two or more mock
      parameters) of the same regular (non-injectable) mocked type.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.6">Version <a href="#0.999.6">0.999.6</a> (January 30, 2011):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Added</strong> support for <strong>TestNG 5.14</strong> (requires listener configuration).
      However, support for older versions of TestNG (5.9-5.11) was dropped.
      Therefore, TestNG users upgrading to this version of JMockit (or newer) may also have to upgrade TestNG.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Changed</strong> the default mocking behavior for overridden <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>
      and <code>toString</code> methods, so that they are mocked by default but still behave according to the standard
      behavior inherited from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=130">issue 130</a>.
      Although unlikely, this change <em>can</em> cause existing tests to break.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in test classes compiled with Eclipse, when recording or verifying an invocation
      with two or more parameters, but with argument matchers used only for some of them <em>and</em> spanning two or
      more source lines.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=114">issue 114</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> potential for conflict between JMockit and other code which happens to reset the global
      system properties object (with <code>System.setProperties(Properties)</code>), or that expects only
      <code>String</code> instances to be stored in it.
      See issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=123">123</a> and
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=129">129</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a bug which caused the occurrence of an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> when
      mocking an interface containing static initializers.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=127">issue 127</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a bug which caused two mock fields for the same mocked interface to receive the same
      instance instead of two different instances.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Optimized</strong> the handling of mock fields declared at the test class level.
      The performance gain should be small but noticeable in a test suite with several test classes containing mock
      fields.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added initial (and still experimental) version of a <strong>new tool</strong>
      (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=134">issue 134</a>):
      the <em><strong>multi-core</strong> test runner</em>. For now, only JUnit is supported.
      The tool transparently assigns test classes to run in different CPU cores (when available), so that they are
      executed in parallel. Code under test does <em>not</em> need to be thread-safe.
      In a dual-core CPU, this reduces the total time of a test run in half.
      In a Core i7 processor with hyper-threading the reduction is proportional, ie, it falls to <em>1/8</em> of the
      regular sequential execution time.
      To use it, simply add <code>jmockit-multicore.jar</code> to the test execution classpath, <em>before</em> the
      jar for JUnit. (The presence of <code>jmockit.jar</code> is not required.)
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.5">Version <a href="#0.999.5">0.999.5</a> (December 28, 2010):</h3>
<p>
   From this version on, the <strong>Java.net</strong> Maven 2 repository is no longer used.
   Project artifacts are now deployed <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/maven-repo/">here</a>.
   Therefore, Maven users should configure the new repository in their <code>pom.xml</code> files.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> conflict with the <strong>EMMA</strong> and <strong>EclEmma</strong> code coverage tools,
      where a <code>ClassFormatError</code> would occur when dynamic mocking was used.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=30">issue 30</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a bug which prevented classes compiled to Java 1.4 or older from being dynamically mocked
      (regular mocking was not affected).
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=117">issue 117</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: added support for the use of <code>@Injectable</code> with <strong>captured</strong>
      mocked instances that are created inside tested code.
      (Capturing of internal instances is enabled by annotating the mock field/parameter with
      <code>@Mocked(capture = n)</code> or <code>@Capturing(maxInstances = n)</code>.)
      This new behavior allows captured instances to "take the place" of the original injectable mock instance.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=119">issue 119</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed</strong> a couple of bugs related to the use of the <code>minTimes</code> and <code>maxTimes</code>
      fields. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=121">issue 121</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Changed</strong> the declaration of <code>mockit.Expectations</code>, <code>mockit.Verifications</code>,
      etc. to make them <code>abstract</code> base classes, in order to avoid a content assist issue with Eclipse JDT.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=122">issue 122</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed/added</strong> support for <code>final</code> mock fields annotated as <code>@NonStrict</code> or
      <code>@Injectable</code>, in particular the <strong>local</strong> ones (declared inside an expectation block).
   </li>
   <li>
      Improved the <strong>Ant</strong> and <strong>Maven</strong> build configurations.
      The Ant "build.properties" file was eliminated.
      All occurrences of the "system" scope for Maven dependencies were eliminated.
      Third-party jar files were removed from the SVN repository and from the main toolkit distribution zip file;
      a separate zip file containing these jars ("jmockit-libs.zip") is now provided for download, for users that want
      to build the project with Ant.
      A full Maven build (with tests) of the top-level module ("jmockit/pom.xml") can be successfully performed, without
      any locally available third-party libraries; the four main modules ("main", "coverage", "hibernate3emul", and
      "incremental") will be built.
      The sample test suites can be executed by running the "test" goal on the top-level samples module
      ("jmockit/samples/pom.xml").
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed the reporting of tests not (re-)executed when using the incremental testing tool for JUnit 4, so that they
      are listed as ignored (in a particular test run).
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.4">Version <a href="#0.999.4">0.999.4</a> (December 5, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: improved support for instance-specific mocking, in the form of a new
      <strong><code>@Injectable</code></strong> annotation. It can be used together with <code>@Mocked</code> or by
      itself.
      Previously, it was necessary to use dynamic partial mocking, often combined with calls to
      <code>onInstance(mock)</code>, in order to restrict mock/stub behavior to a single mocked instance.
      This is important in cases where the behavior of other instances of the same mocked type could be inadvertently
      affected. (For example, when mocking standard JRE classes which might be used internally by other JRE classes.)
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=113">issue 113</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>constructorArgsMethod</code> attribute from the <code>@Mocked</code>
      annotation. This attribute was only rarely, if ever, actually useful. Existing tests that use it (hopefully no
      more than a few, if any at all) can be modified to directly instantiate the mocked class with the desired
      constructor.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: mocked instances automatically created to supply mock fields and parameters are
      now instantiated without going through any constructor. This avoids certain complications when partial mocking is
      used, and generally makes the Expectations API more robust. It relates to the previous change item, which allowed
      the selection of constructors when instantiating mocked classes.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: <em>cascaded</em> mock instances created from a <code>@Cascading</code> mocked type
      will now behave like <code>@Injectable</code> ones, so that other instances of the same type are not inadvertently
      affected. This also allows a regular (non-mocked) instance of the cascaded type to take the place of the default
      mocked instance; simply assign the regular object to the <code>result</code> field, after a call to the
      appropriate non-void method.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: added support for the mocking of the <code>java.lang.Object</code> class through the
      Expectations API (the <code>wait</code> and <code>notify</code> methods, in particular, can now be mocked by
      declaring a mock field/parameter of type <code>Object</code>).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: when matching invocations to expectations, parameters of array type are now compared
      by value rather than by reference. This applies to arrays having any number of dimensions.
      Previously, a call to <code>withEqual(arrayValue)</code> was required for this.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug where an <code>UnsatisfiedLinkError</code> could occur when mocking native methods from the JRE.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=106">issue 106</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the matching of expectations for methods containing a "varargs" parameter.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=107">issue 107</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      General review of API documentation, Tutorial, and other documentation pages.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.3">Version <a href="#0.999.3">0.999.3</a> (October 3, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: new attribute <code>stubOutClassInitialization</code> added to the
      <code>@Mocked</code> annotation, with support for a new <code>jmockit-retainStaticInitializers</code> system
      property which allows global configuration of the default behavior.
      See issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=96">96</a> and
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=103">103</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the JUnit 3.8 integration.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=101">issue 101</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Replaced use of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify">prettify.js</a> with
      <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en">highlight.js</a>, to fix issues with IE.
   </li>
   <li>
      A few other small fixes and enhancements.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.2">Version <a href="#0.999.2">0.999.2</a> (August 22, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed deprecated classes</strong>: <code>JMockit</code>, <code>JMockitTest</code>,
      <code>JMockitTestCase</code>, and <code>JMockitTestNG</code>.
      Note that instructions to replace these classes in existing tests are included as deprecation
      comments in the corresponding API documentation of previous releases.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>High-performance mocking of interfaces</strong> (Expectations API):
      the support for mocking Java interfaces was re-implemented to significantly reduce the
      overhead in execution time for tests which use one or more mocked interfaces.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Optimized</strong> the mocking of classes by caching modified bytecode.
      This provides a significant performance gain when the same class is mocked by many tests in
      the same test run.
   </li>
   <li>
      Eliminated the validation for duplicate expectations.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=82">issue 82</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: added a new constructor to the <code>MockUp&lt;T></code> class,
      which takes the class to be mocked as an argument, instead of obtaining it from the type
      variable <code>T</code>. Useful when the class to mock is unknown or non-accessible.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=95">issue 95</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a few bugs in <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>.
      See issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=88">88</a> and
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=89">89</a>.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999.1">Version <a href="#0.999.1">0.999.1</a> (July 25, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed bug</strong>: the special <code>Object</code> methods
      (<code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>, <code>toString</code>, <code>finalize</code>),
      when they happened to have an abstract override in a subclass, would get mocked by default
      when the concrete mock subclass was created; now, they get empty implementations unless
      explicitly selected for mocking through mock filters.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed bug</strong>: in the event that a non-strict invocation, while being handled
      internally by JMockit, would trigger another non-strict invocation during replay (typically,
      during the execution of a <em>delegate</em> method), a
      <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> could occur.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed bug</strong>: the utility methods for <em>constructor invocation</em> through
      Reflection (see <code>Deencapsulation</code> or <code>Expectations</code>) were not correctly
      finding constructors with parameters for which a subtype argument could be passed (for
      example, when passing an <code>ArrayList</code> instance to a <code>List</code> parameter).
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=77">issue 77</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: improved the error message for situations were an attempt is
      made to record or verify an expectation on a type which is not mocked at the point the
      invocation appears (it previously was <code>"No current invocation available"</code>).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Robustness issue solved</strong>: when mocking certain JRE classes such as
      <code>java.net.URL</code> and <code>java.io.FileInputStream</code>, unexpected test failures
      could occur.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.999">Version <a href="#0.999">0.999</a> (July 15, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the following <em>deprecated methods</em> from the
      <code>Mockit</code> class: <code>redefineMethods(...)</code> (all four variations),
      <code>restoreOriginalDefinition(...)</code>, and <code>restoreAllOriginalDefinitions()</code>.
      If tests using these methods still exist, they will have to be changed according to the
      instructions provided in the API documentation (from release 0.997, in which the methods were
      deprecated).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the following JUnit/TestNG integration support classes:
      <code>JMockitTestCase</code>, <code>JMockitTest</code>, <code>JMockit</code> (custom runner
      for JUnit 4.5+ tests), and <code>JMockitTestNG</code>. All they ever did was make sure that
      JMockit got initialized at start-up. This is best done through other means, which have been
      available for some time.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New validation</strong> implemented to detect uses of the Expectations API from an invalid context, such
      as a static <code>@BeforeClass</code> JUnit method.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Bug fixes</strong> in the "Java agent" auto-initialization under JDK 1.6, when not
      using the "-javaagent" JVM parameter:
      1) When using JUnit, the agent would not get loaded if another jar file named like
      "jmockit-xyz.jar" (such as "jmockit-coverage.jar", for example) was present in the classpath
      <em>before</em> the actual "jmockit.jar".
      2) When using only JMockit Coverage, without "jmockit.jar" directly added to the classpath,
      that jar file wasn't found and consequently JMockit never got initialized.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Fixed a bug</strong> in the validation for duplicate non-strict expectations, which
      was rejecting expectations recorded for the same method but with different argument matching
      constraints, when the actual argument values passed to the method had the same values in each
      recorded invocation.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=62">issue 62</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong> to the use of <code>Delegate</code> objects: when there is only
      one delegate method, it is allowed to have no parameters even if the corresponding mocked
      method has them.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancements</strong> in the support for testing multi-threaded code with the
      Expectations API:
      a) a delegate method is now allowed to execute code in a different thread, even if such code
      invokes other mocked methods (previously, this situation would cause a dead-lock).
      b) if an unexpected invocation occurs in a thread other than the test thread, the test will
      now fail just as if it had occurred in the regular test thread.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.998">Version <a href="#0.998">0.998</a> (April 21, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the following <em>deprecated methods</em>:
      <code>Mockit.assertExpectations()</code>;
      <code>throwsException(Exception)</code> and <code>throwsError(Error)</code> from the
      <code>Expectations</code> class;
      <code>repeats(int)</code>, <code>repeatsAtLeast(int)</code>, <code>repeatsAtMost(int)</code>,
      and <code>repeats(int, int)</code> from the <code>Invocations</code> base class;
      and <code>withAny()</code> also from the <code>Invocations</code> class.
      The <code>Invocations#withAny(T)</code> method is no longer deprecated, as it is useful in
      certain situations where a non-null argument value is needed.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancements to the
      <code>Expectations#returns(Object firstValue, Object... remainingValues)</code> method:
      when used for methods of return type <code>Set</code>, <code>SortedSet</code>,
      <code>Iterator</code>, or array, the individual elements contained in the collection,
      iterator or array will be the ones directly specified as arguments.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New validation</strong> implemented for uses of the Expectations API, applicable when
      recording non-strict expectations: previously, duplicate expectations were simply ignored;
      now, such occurrences cause an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> to be thrown.
      Note that this change can cause existing tests to break, if they inadvertently recorded
      duplicate non-strict expectations; to fix such tests, the duplicate expectations will have to be removed.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=42">issue 42</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixes and enhancements to the support for mocking <strong>Java enums</strong> with the
      Expectations API: the first enum value will now be used as the default for mock fields and
      parameters of enum type; cascading will now work as expected for methods that return an enum value.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the JUnit 3.8 integration, where <code>TestCase</code> subclasses overriding the
      <code>runTest()</code> method (such as <code>GWTTestCase</code>) would not work properly with JMockit in the
      classpath. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=37">issue 37</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug of omission in the use of <code>@Cascading</code>, when expectations are recorded on a cascaded mock
      through a separate mock field/parameter, and there are two or more mocks of the same cascaded type.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=38">issue 38</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug of omission in tests with two or more mocks of the same type, where one of them is declared as
      <code>@NonStrict</code>. The issue was that all other mocks were also considered non-strict, when they should be
      strict. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=39">issue 39</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the <em>dynamic partial mocking</em> feature: when a method with no recorded expectation was called
      more than once during the replay phase, only the first invocation was executing the real implementation.
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=40">issue 40</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug that prevented consecutive values to be returned from a cascaded mock, when recording a sequence of
      return values through the <code>result</code> field or the <code>returns(...)</code> varargs method.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong> for JMockit Coverage: the <code>jmockit-coverage-metrics</code>
      system property can now be used to select the desired combination of the three available code
      coverage metrics. Its value should be a comma-separated list containing one or more of the
      following words: "line", "path", "data", and "all".
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.997">Version <a href="#0.997">0.997</a> (March 3, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      The <strong>dynamic partial mocking</strong> feature (Expectations API) was re-implemented,
      with richer semantics (the API itself was not changed).
      Now only the invocations to dynamically mocked types that occur during the replay phase and
      that actually match a recorded expectation will be mocked; all other invocations will cause
      the real method/constructor implementation to be executed.
      Additionally, invocations to such mocked types can also be verified inside verification blocks.
      (Invocations to mocked types will never execute the real implementation when they occur
      <em>inside</em> an expectation or verification block.)
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the "<strong><code>withAny</code></strong>" methods defined in
      the base <code>Invocations</code> class.
      The newer "<strong><code>any</code></strong>" fields should be used instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> old methods in the <code>Mockit</code> class which belong to the Core API:
      <code>redefineMethods(...)</code>, <code>restoreOriginalDefinition(...)</code>, and
      <code>restoreAllOriginalDefinitions()</code>.
      Equivalent methods to be used are indicated in the API documentation for the deprecated methods.
      Usually, however, it's best to use the <code>MockUp&lt;T></code> generic base class
      when a state-oriented mock class is needed. The deprecated methods will eventually be removed.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancements to the support of <strong><em>varargs</em> parameters</strong> in the Expectations & Verifications
      API:
      <ul>
         <li>
            Any number of variable argument values can be matched by passing an
            "<strong><code>(Object[]) <em>any</em></code></strong>" argument matching constraint to
            a recorded/verified expectation ("<strong><code>(Object[]) null</code></strong>" can
            also be used when another argument matcher is specified for the same invocation).
         </li>
         <li>
            Now it's possible to use matchers only on the regular parameters of a varargs method or constructor, without
            any matchers specified for the varargs values (before, a matcher was needed for each varargs value).
            Matchers for <em>some</em> varargs values only is <em>not</em> supported, though.
            In addition, unless no matchers at all are used, the last regular parameter preceding the varargs parameter
            (if any) must use a matcher.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      A few fixes and enhancements to JMockit's internal auto-initialization mechanisms:
      <code>jmockit.jar</code> (or a versioned jar name) can now be loaded from a remote file system without triggering
      a security-related exception; when running under JDK 1.5, the presence of <code>jmockit.jar</code> in the
      classpath when <code>-javaagent:jmockit.jar</code> was not used will no longer cause a JMockit-specific exception
      to be thrown, unless the mocking API is actually used in a test.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancements to <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>New feature</strong>: an aggregate XHTML report can now be generated by executing the Java
            <code>main</code> method added to the <code>mockit.coverage.CodeCoverage</code> class (in the main coverage
            jar).
            The first argument (<code>args[0]</code>) to the program must be a comma-separated list of paths to
            directories containing "coverage.ser" data files.
            These data files are merged together and an aggregate report is immediately generated.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Enhancement</strong>: to avoid the need for managing "coverage.ser" files
            generated in the same directory, the <code>jmockit-coverage-serial.jar</code> file and
            the <code>serial</code> output specifier were created as an alternative to "merge".
            The difference is that "merge" reads in an existing data file, while "serial" only writes it out at the end.
         </li>
         <li>
            The summary page of the XHTML report now provides extra information, in addition to
            coverage percentages for each metric:
            1) the number of <em>covered</em> and <em>total</em> items from which coverage
            percentages were calculated are now shown in tooltips over the percentage values;
            2) the list of packages and the list of source files of each package can now be
            <em>sorted by size</em>, where "size" has a different meaning for each metric (total
            number of executable <em>line segments</em> for line coverage, total number of
            <em>paths</em> for path coverage, and total number of <em>fields</em> for data coverage).
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue introduced in the previous release, when <em>static initializers</em> became stubbed out by default
      (Expectations API): mock filters (where <code>"&lt;clinit>"</code> specifies static initializers) were not
      considering the inclusion/exclusion of static initializers.
      In particular, the empty filter <code>@Mocked("")</code> previously excluded all methods and constructors from
      being mocked, but still caused static initializers to be stubbed out; now they are also ignored.
   </li>
   <li>
      Bugs fixed in JMockit Coverage: certain source code constructs could cause a NPE to be thrown during generation of
      the XHTML report; see also <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=33">issue 33</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the JMockit-TestNG integration: invocation count constraints specified on mock methods annotated
      with <code>@Mock(...)</code> were not being verified after the execution of a test method.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.996">Version <a href="#0.996">0.996</a> (January 24, 2010):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the following methods of the <em>Expectations & Verifications</em> API:
      <code>throwsException(e)</code>, <code>throwsError(e)</code>, <code>repeats(n)</code>,
      <code>repeats(m, n)</code>, <code>repeatsAtLeast(n)</code>, <code>repeatsAtMost(n)</code>.
      Calls to these methods in existing tests should be replaced with <em>assignments</em> to the corresponding
      <em>fields</em> <code>result</code>, <code>times</code>, <code>minTimes</code>, and <code>maxTimes</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <code>forEachInvocation</code> field was created, for use both in expectation
      and verification blocks. It's similar to <code>Delegate</code> objects, but more convenient and capable (since
      delegates can only be used in expectation blocks).
      The focus is on <em>invocation argument validation</em> rather than on making invocations produce expected
      results.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancements to the <strong>Verifications API</strong>:
      <ul>
         <li>
            Verification blocks now can "import" mocks from local fields declared in expectation
            blocks used in the same test, by declaring local fields of their own with the same mocked type.
            (See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=4">issue 4</a>.)
         </li>
         <li>
            <em>Full</em> verification blocks, used to force explicit verification of <em>all</em>
            invocations, now can be restricted to a subset of the mock objects or mocked types used in the test.
            (See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=5">issue 5</a>.)
         </li>
         <li>
            The <code>onInstance(mock)</code> method, previously only available in expectation blocks, now can also be
            used in verification blocks.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong> and <em>potentially breaking change</em>:
      to make it easier to match invocations on the invoked instance, the semantics obtained from a
      call to <code>onInstance(mock)</code> are now <em>implied</em> whenever a test method has in
      its scope two or more mock fields/parameters of the exact same mocked type.
      This change greatly reduces the cases where explicit calls to <code>onInstance(mock)</code> were needed, but it
      may break existing tests.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: the <code>mockit.Invocation</code> class (optionally used as the first parameter in <em>delegate</em>
      or <code>forEachInvocation</code>-<em>handler</em> methods) now has a new read-only property,
      <strong><code>invokedInstance</code></strong>.
      The getter will return the mock or real object on which the corresponding method/constructor invocation occurred
      (except, naturally, for <code>static</code> methods).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: the <code>with(matcher)</code> and <code>with(T, matcher)</code> methods of the base
      <code>Invocations</code> class now accept arbitrary <em>invocation handler</em> objects in addition to
      <code>org.hamcrest.Matcher</code> implementations.
      Such objects are easier to create (they do not require the implementation of a method that generates failure
      messages, nor the addition of Hamcrest classes to the classpath) and allow the use of <code>assert</code>
      statements or <code>assertXyz(...)</code> calls instead of returning a <code>boolean</code> value.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: static initializers in classes mocked with the Expectations API now are stubbed out by default (they
      were left unchanged before, requiring the user to explicitly stub them out when needed).
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: the <code>returns(Object, Object...)</code> method of the <code>Expectations</code> class can now be
      used to easily specify a list of values to be returned from a method whose return type is <code>List</code>,
      <code>Collection</code>, or <code>Iterable</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: four new utility methods created in the <code>Deencapsulation</code> class, all of them overloading
      existing methods (see issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=23">23</a> and
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=26">26</a>).
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancements to <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>:
      <ul>
         <li>
            In the XHTML report, information on source files can now be interactively hidden and re-displayed, both for
            the whole list of files and for each package.
            This makes it easy to focus only on package results, for example, in particular when there is a large number
            of source files.
            (Requires a JavaScript-enabled browser, though.)
         </li>
         <li>
            Blocks of commented lines in source files are now collapsed by default.
            They can be un-collapsed by clicking on the block.
         </li>
         <li>
            A <strong>new metric</strong> was introduced: <em>data coverage</em>.
            In this release, it accounts for static and instance non-<code>final</code> fields only.
            A field is considered to be covered (shown in green in the formatted source file) if at least one test left
            no unread values from previous assignments to the field; otherwise, the field is considered not covered
            (shown in red).
            Newer releases will expand and improve this metric, with the goal of using it to discover missing assertions
            in tests.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the capture of fields whose mocked type is an interface (a NPE would occur when the constructor of
      a captured implementation class was transformed).
   </li>
   <li>
      New "Tour de Mock" sample test suite created, based on code published in a
      <a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2009/07/tour-de-mock-spring">series of articles</a>.
      There is a test class written with each of the usual mocking APIs (EasyMock CE, jMock, Mockito, Unitils Mock,
      JMockit), plus another one which uses Spring Test.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.995">Version <a href="#0.995">0.995</a> (December 20, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Hamcrest 1.2</strong> classes are no longer included in <code>jmockit.jar</code>.
      The "<code>withXyz(...)</code>" argument matching methods are unaffected, except for the two of them which
      accepted a custom matcher as an implementation of <code>org.hamcrest.Matcher</code>: they still exist and work the
      same, but the parameter type has been changed to <code>Object</code>.
      Tests using any of these two methods will need to be recompiled.
      Note also that to use one of these two methods the proper Hamcrest classes will have to be available in the
      classpath (for example, from <code>junit-4.8.jar</code>).
      (See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=13">issue 13</a>.)
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <strong><code>@Cascading</code></strong> annotation was created to enable
      automatic <em>cascading</em> of invocations to mocked types.
      The cascade effect continues indefinitely for the return types of methods invoked on a cascading mocked type;
      cascade return values will be mock instances created on demand.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: code inside test classes now can safely use the <code>assert</code> keyword,
      independently of assertions being enabled or not through the "-ea"/"-enableassertions" JVM initialization
      parameter.
      (This doesn't affect assertions in production code, though, which still should be enabled manually if needed.)
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <strong><code>result</code></strong> field was added to the
      <code>Expectations</code> base class, as an alternative to the <code>returns</code> and
      <code>throwsException/throwsError</code> methods.
      Note that this new field will cause compilation errors in tests that already use a field of the same name inside
      an expectation block; such tests will need to be changed to use a different field name.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <strong><code>times</code></strong>, <strong><code>minTimes</code></strong> and
      <strong><code>maxTimes</code></strong> fields were added to the <code>Invocations</code> base class, as an
      alternative to the <code>repeats/repeatsAtLeast/repeatsAtMost</code> methods.
      The same warning in the previous item about potential conflicts with existing fields applies here.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <strong><code>$</code></strong> special field, of type
      <code>java.lang.CharSequence</code>, was added to the <code>Invocations</code> base class to allow the
      specification of custom error messages for specific expectations.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <strong><code>jmockit-tools</code></strong> system property can now be used to
      specify which external tools JMockit should load at startup.
      More than one tool can be specified, by separating the tool names with commas.
      A tool name must be the fully qualified name of a mock class, or a "startup tool" mnemonic configured in the
      <code>jmockit.properties</code> file.
      For example, "coverage" stands for JMockit Coverage. (See issue 22.)
   </li>
   <li>
      More fixes and enhancements to <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>:
      <ul>
         <li>
            Nested/inner classes which never get loaded during a test run are now properly handled.
            Before, the code in them simply wasn't considered at all in the line and path metrics.
         </li>
         <li>
            For packages containing at least one class exercised by the test run, the XHTML report
            will now also show the source files not exercised.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>New feature</strong>: individual <em>line segments</em> are now shown in the report, with the
            execution count for each segment displayed in a tooltip.
            This significantly improves the display of both line and path coverage inside a source file.
            In this release, however, the implementation is still incomplete, with certain cases not properly handled.
            (See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=8">issue 8</a>.)
         </li>
         <li>
            Data file generation in XML format is no longer supported.
            If post-processing of coverage results is needed, then the serialized "merge" file can be used instead.
         </li>
         <li>Several other small improvements.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in JUnit 3.8 integration, where a <code>TestCase</code> subclass overriding the
      <code>getName()</code> method could cause JMockit to not find the test method
      (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=21">issue 21</a>).
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.994">Version <a href="#0.994">0.994</a> (December 6, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Multiple enhancements to <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>:
      <ul>
         <li>
            The <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code> file now also refers to <code>jmockit.jar</code>
            through the <code>Class-Path</code> property in <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>.
            This makes it possible to generate coverage reports by adding a single jar to the
            classpath when running a test suite which makes no use of the JMockit mocking APIs.
            All jar files of the JMockit toolkit must still be present in the same directory,
            though.
         </li>
         <li>
            The desired output formats can now be specified through the
            <strong><code>jmockit-coverage-output</code></strong> system property.
            (When not specified, the basic XHTML report will be generated.)
            Note that the property can be defined by a
            "-Djmockit-coverage-output=fmt1,fmt2,..." JVM command line argument, or by a
            <code>&lt;property></code> element in a Maven <code>pom.xml</code> or Ant
            <code>build.xml</code> file.
         </li>
         <li>
            The output directory for "coverage.xml" and "coverage.ser" files, as well as for the 
            files of an XHTML report, can now be specified through the
            <strong><code>jmockit-coverage-outputDir</code></strong> system property.
            (When not specified, the current working dir is used.)
         </li>
         <li>
            The list of directories containing Java source files, needed for the XHTML report, can
            now be specified through the <strong><code>jmockit-coverage-srcDirs</code></strong>
            system property.
            (When not specified, all "src" directories under the current working dir are searched.)
            If the property is specified but with an empty value, then no source directories will be
            searched and the report will only contain the index page.
         </li>
         <li>
            A regular expression for selecting the Java classes which should be considered for
            coverage can now be specified through the
            <strong><code>jmockit-coverage-classes</code></strong> system property.
            (When not specified, all classes from production code which are loaded during the test
            run and are not inside jar files will be considered.)
         </li>
         <li>
            Independently of <code>jmockit-coverage-classes</code> being specified or not, the
            <strong><code>jmockit-coverage-excludes</code></strong> system property can be used to
            specify a regular expression for class names which should be excluded from
            consideration.
         </li>
         <li>
            The automatic class selection mechanism, used when no classes to consider for coverage
            are explicitly specified, will now also ignore class files from any directory whose name
            ends in "<code>/test-classes</code>" (note that this is the default output directory for
            test classes used by Maven 2).
         </li>
         <li>
            The total coverage percentage is now calculated and shown in the XHTML report
            (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=7">issue 7</a>).
         </li>
         <li>
            A <strong><em>path coverage</em></strong> metric has been implemented
            (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=12">issue 12</a>), which is
            completely separate from the current <em>code coverage</em> metric.
            In this release, the implementation is still incomplete, lacking support for
            "<code>try</code>" blocks.
         </li>
         <li>
            The XHTML report now uses <strong><code>prettify.js</code></strong> (from the
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify">Google Code Prettify project</a>)
            for syntax coloring in Java source files.
            This makes report generation faster and smaller, but requires a JavaScript-enabled
            browser for the proper viewing of source file pages.
            (JavaScript is also used for other features in such pages.)
            The "index.html" page, on the other hand, makes no use of JavaScript so any XHTML+CSS
            browser (such as the one embedded in Eclipse) can be used without any loss.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <code>mockit.Invocation</code> class was created for
      optional use in <code>Delegate</code> methods.
      (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=6">issue 6</a>).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Deprecated</strong> the method <code>Mockit.assertExpectations()</code>, which will be
      removed in a later release.
      Existing tests which happen to use it should simply remove any calls, since verification of
      invocation count constraints specified on <code>@Mock</code> methods is done automatically by
      JMockit.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> the <code>mockit.RealMethodNotFoundForMockException</code> class.
      This runtime exception was thrown when an attempt was made to apply a mock class (using either
      the Core or Annotations API) to a production class, but there was at least one mock method in
      the mock class for which no matching real method could be found in the production class.
      Now an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> will be thrown instead for the same situation,
      with no loss of information (which is fully captured in the exception message).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New validation for the Expectations API</strong>: new users often make the mistake of
      not declaring any mocked types for a test.
      To provide a helpful error message in such situations, the creation of an
      <code>Expectations</code> block will now throw an <code>IllegalStateException</code> if there
      are no mocked types in scope.
      Note that this change may break existing tests, although it should be rare to have expectation
      blocks for which no mocked type is available.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in JUnit 3.8 integration: if a base test class did override the
      <code>junit.framework.TestCase#runBare()</code> method, a duplicate execution of this overridden method would
      occur. The integration was changed so that <code>runBare()</code> can now safely be overridden.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.993">Version <a href="#0.993">0.993</a> (November 15, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: to make JMockit easier to use when running under JDK 1.6+
      without the <code>-javaagent</code> JVM parameter, two simplifications were introduced:
      <ol>
         <li>
            The <code>&lt;jdkDir>/lib/tools.jar</code> file no longer needs to be added to
            classpath.
         </li>
         <li>
            Test classes no longer need to be annotated with <code>@RunWith(JMockit.class)</code>
            (for JUnit 4 tests), nor extend a JUnit/TestNG integration base class
            (<code>JMockitTest</code>, <code>JMockitTestCase</code>, <code>JMockitTestNG</code>).
         </li>
      </ol>
      There is a requirement for the second item when using JUnit, though: <code>jmockit.jar</code>
      needs to come <em>before</em> <code>junit-4.x.jar</code> in the classpath.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Removed</strong> several API elements which were deprecated in releases 0.980 and
      0.989.
      Existing tests still using them will require the changes indicated below (all trivial,
      though):
      <ol>
         <li>The <code>@MockField</code> annotation: simply replace with <code>@Mocked</code>.</li>
         <li>
            The <code>Verifications#neverHappens()</code> method: replace with a
            <code>repeats(0);</code> call right after the invocation to be verified.
         </li>
         <li>
            The <code>Expectations#invokeReturning</code> generic method: use the
            <code>returns</code> method instead.
         </li>
         <li>The <code>Expectations#endReplay()</code> method: simply remove any calls to it.</li>
         <li>
            The <code>Expectations.assertSatisfied()</code> static method: this method was
            deprecated in the previous release, and is also being removed now because it does the 
            same as <code>endReplay()</code>.
         </li>
         <li>
            The <code>Expectations.restoreFieldTypeDefinitions()</code> static method: either remove
            any calls to it, or replace them with calls to
            <code>Mockit.restoreAllOriginalDefinitions()</code>, which has the same effect.
         </li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature in JMockit Coverage</strong>: the ability to merge coverage data from
      consecutive test runs was implemented. This allows the generation of a single aggregate report
      from multiple test runs (for the same test suite or not).
      See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=3">issue 3</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the mocking of certain JRE classes (notably <code>java.io.File</code>) that
      are used during the class loading process triggered by the JVM.
      This avoids the occurrence of a <code>ClassCircularityError</code> under certain situations
      (in particular, when classes used in a test are loaded on demand by the JVM and a critical
      JRE class is mocked at the same time).
   </li>
   <li>
      Published <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code> in the Java.net Maven 2 repository.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.992">Version <a href="#0.992">0.992</a> (November 8, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New features</strong> that improve the use of
      <a href="tutorial/BehaviorBasedTesting.html#argumentMatching">argument matching constraints</a> with the
      Expectations/Verifications API:
      <ol>
         <li>
            It is no longer necessary to specify matchers for <em>all</em> arguments in an invocation.
            Regular arguments will be matched on equality, as they would if no explicit matchers at all were used.
         </li>
         <li>
            Argument matching <em>fields</em> were added to the <code>mockit.Invocations</code> base
            class; they are equivalent to the <code>T withAny()</code>/<code>T withAny(T)</code> methods:
            <code>any</code>, <code>anyInt</code>, <code>anyBoolean</code>, etc.
         </li>
         <li>
            The <code>null</code> reference can now be used to match any object reference, instead
            of <code>withAny()</code> (or instead of the new <code>any</code> field), as long as
            there is at least one explicit matcher specified for the invocation.
         </li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Enhancement</strong>: when using the Expectations API to mock JRE classes (for
      example, <code>java.lang.System</code> or <code>java.io.InputStreamReader</code>), all methods
      can safely be mocked even if JMockit itself or other parts of the JRE need to execute the
      original code (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/issues/detail?id=2">issue 2</a>).
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: <code>Delegate</code> implementation classes can now define a method named differently from the
      recorded method to which the delegation applies, provided it's the only method in the delegate class.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: in the Annotations API, the method <code>Mockit.setUpMock(Object)</code> now also
      accepts a <code>Class</code> object for the mock class, instead of only an instance of the
      mock class. This should avoid confusion with the <code>Mockit.setUpMocks(Object...)</code>
      method, which always accepted both ways of passing the mock class.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: better support for <em>covariant return types</em>, so that an expectation
      recorded for a method with a more specific return type can be matched to an invocation with a
      less specific but compatible return type.
   </li>
   <li>
      For better robustness, when an object to be partially mocked is passed to the
      <code>Expectations</code> or <code>NonStrictExpectations</code> constructor which has a
      "varargs" parameter, only <em>methods</em> are now considered for mocking, not the
      <em>constructors</em> of the classes to which the given object belongs.
      This change can break existing tests, but is not likely to do so because in such cases the
      test should not be recording expectations on constructors which were used to create the
      partially mocked object in the first place.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a couple of bugs with the <em>capturing</em> of new instances through mock fields.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue which prevented the use of verification blocks inside "after" methods (ie,
      <code>tearDown</code>, <code>@After</code>, or <code>@AfterMethod</code>).
   </li>
   <li>
      The old method <code>Expectations.assertSatisfied()</code> (which has been unnecessary for a
      long time already), was deprecated in this release and will be removed for version 1.0.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the Maven 2 project file (<code>pom.xml</code>) for
      <code>jmockit.jar</code>: internal dependencies (on JUnit, TestNG, etc.) were made
      <em>optional</em> so they won't be transitively added as dependencies in client Maven
      projects.
   </li>
   <li>
      JMockit x Unitils comparison test suite upgraded to Unitils 3.0, with some new tests added.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.991">Version <a href="#0.991">0.991</a> (October 25, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      The chapter on <a href="tutorial/StateBasedTesting.html">state-based testing</a>
      (Annotations API) in the <strong>JMockit Tutorial</strong> is now complete.
   </li>
   <li>
      Created two new overloads for the <code>Mockit#stubOutClass</code> method which take a class
      name instead of a <code>Class</code> object, for cases where the real class is not accessible
      from the test class.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: the <code>@Mock</code> annotation can now be applied to methods in reusable mock
      classes that are extended by more specific ones. The mock methods in the base mock class will
      be inherited by the mock subclass.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: mock method overrides are now supported, to further enable the reuse of base mock
      classes with the Annotations and Core APIs.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: a mocked field or parameter can now rely on the
      <code>@Mocked(realClassName = "...")</code> annotation attribute to specify the class of the
      mock object to be instantiated. The actual field/parameter type will not be considered for
      mocking. This can be used to mock non-accessible classes (for example, private nested
      classes), by declaring the field/parameter as being of type <code>Object</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: implemented support for mock filters in captured implementation classes (when
      <code>@Capturing</code> or <code>@Mocked(capture = n)</code> is used with
      <code>@Mocked(methods = "...")</code> for the same field or parameter).
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug with mocked types in the Expectations API: when different types (usually classes)
      were mocked for a test which records invocations to methods of same signature but belonging to
      different classes, then the corresponding expectations got wrongly matched, causing the test
      to fail (issue 37).
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the handling of invocation count constraints specified through the
      <code>@Mock</code> annotation: when the same test applied two different mock classes which
      both specify such constraints for the <em>same</em> real class, only one set of constraints
      was discarded at the end of the test; this could then cause other tests to fail later.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0.990">Version <a href="#0.990">0.990</a> (October 4/6, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Enhancement: previously, when an anonymous inner class was used as the mock class with the
      Core/Annotations API, and the mocked class was defined in a different package, an
      <code>IllegalAccessError</code> would occur.
      The mocking bridge is now used internally to delegate such mock invocations, in order to avoid
      the JVM error.
      Therefore, anonymous inner classes can now be safely used as mock classes, thereby avoiding
      the need to define them as separate named classes.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: added the parameterized <strong><code>mockit.MockUp&lt;T></code></strong>
      class to the Annotations API, in order to facilitate the definition of state-based mock
      classes. This class will be most useful inside individual test methods.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: added support for mocking annotation types with the Expectations API.
      It's just like mocking interfaces, where read access to annotation attributes can be recorded
      and/or verified through regular method invocations on the annotation instance created by
      JMockit.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: added a validation in the <code>returns(...)</code> methods that will throw an
      <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> whenever a non-null return value is specified for a
      mocked constructor or void method.
      Specifying null values to be returned from constructor or void methods <em>is</em> valid
      though, in order to allow multiple consecutive results to be recorded when one or more of the
      invocations should do nothing.
      Notice that this change will break any existing tests that happen to violate this validation
      rule.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added support for mock parameters in JUnit 3.8 test methods (for JUnit 4 and TestNG they were
      already supported).<br/>
      <span style="color: red">October 6</span>: release 0.990 updated with a small fix so that
      <code>static</code> methods which otherwise qualify as test methods are ignored.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the JUnit 3.8 integration, where mocks applied by a test method remained in
      effect inside a <code>tearDown()</code> method, and mocks applied by a <code>setUp()</code>
      method were restored automatically after each test method execution (when they should need to
      be restored manually, for consistency).
   </li>
   <li>
      For the Expectations API, added synchronization to the main entry point to JMockit internals
      from modified code under test, to avoid race conditions when such code runs in multiple
      threads.
   </li>
   <li>
      For the Annotations API, added synchronization to the incrementing of mock invocation counts,
      to avoid race conditions when code under test creates and runs in additional threads.
   </li>
   <li>
      Improved the error message generated for failed mock expectations (specified through the
      <code>@Mock</code> annotation), so that the real class/interface name is also included.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug which caused an <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code> in a test method containing
      two expectation blocks, where the first one records strict expectations which are fully
      replayed before the second block starts (issue 35).
      This actually amounts to a test with two <em>replay</em> phases, which isn't proper use of the
      API, even though it <em>is</em> allowed.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.989 (September 20, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      The chapter on <a href="tutorial/BehaviorBasedTesting.html">behavior-based testing</a> in the
      <strong>JMockit Tutorial</strong> is complete for the first time with this release.
   </li>
   <li>
      All classes from <strong>Hamcrest 1.2</strong> previously embedded in <code>jmockit.jar</code>
      have been removed, except for those that JMockit itself needs for the
      <code>withXyz(...)</code> argument matching methods available in the
      <code>Expectations & Verifications</code> API.
      This means that existing test suites that make use of Hamcrest matchers no longer available in
      <code>jmockit.jar</code> will now need to find those extra classes somewhere else (usually in
      <code>hamcrest-library-1.x.jar</code>).
      This change was made to avoid conflicts with potentially different versions of Hamcrest that
      may happen to be in the classpath used for running tests.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added support for the delegation of mocked constructor invocations when using the
      <code>Delegate</code> interface. The corresponding delegate method must be named "$init".
   </li>
   <li>
      Added support for the verification (inside any kind of <code>Verifications</code> block) of
      invocations that should not have happened through a regular call to <code>repeats(0)</code>.
      Previously, this was achieved through a call to <code>neverHappens()</code> that should be
      made <em>before</em> the verified invocation (the <code>repeats</code> methods are always to
      be called <em>after</em> the corresponding invocations).
   </li>
   <li>
      As a consequence of the previous enhancement, the <code>Verifications#neverHappens()</code>
      method is now deprecated, and will be removed before version 1.0 is released.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: inside a <code>FullVerifications</code> or <code>FullVerificationsInOrder</code>
      block, a call to <code>repeatsAtLeast(0)</code> (or <code>repeats(0, &lt;big number>)</code>)
      will now allow the preceding invocation to be ignored.
      This can be useful when a test needs to verify that certain invocations did not occur in the
      replay phase, while at the same time allowing other invocations to have occurred any number of
      times (including zero).
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: the Reflection-based utility methods previously defined in the
      <code>Expectations</code> class have been moved to the base <code>Invocations</code> class, so
      they can also be used from <code>Verifications</code> subclasses.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug which caused a <code>ClassCastException</code> in the capturing of new instances
      (for example, <code>@Mocked(capture = 1) Callable<?> mock;</code>) when the mocked type is
      parameterized.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug which caused capturing mock fields declared at the test class level to not capture
      new instances in tests which also declared a local capturing field.
   </li>
   <li>
      The old methods <code>Expectations#endReplay()</code> (which has become unnecessary),
      <code>Expectations#invokeReturning</code> (which is redundant and inconsistent), and
      <code>Expectations#restoreFieldTypeDefinitions()</code> (also redundant and normally
      unnecessary) were deprecated in this release and will be removed for version 1.0.
      <br/>
      The methods <code>Expectations#endRecording()</code> and
      <code>Expectations#assertSatisfied()</code> were <em>not</em> deprecated, even though they
      should be rarely, if ever, used. This is emphasized in the API documentation, though.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.988 (September 6, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      JMockit Core/Annotations: implemented support for mocking constructors of a JRE class with
      mock constructors in a mock class.
      Previously, this could only be done with a <code>$init</code> mock method.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the TestNG integration, where parameters in test methods which rely on a
      <code>@org.testng.annotations.DataProvider</code> were being inadvertently mocked.
   </li>
   <li>
      Implemented basic support for running tests in parallel in TestNG.
      The use of <code>@Test(invocationCount=5, threadPoolSize=2)</code>, for example, should not
      cause a NPE inside <code>mockit.integration.testng.TestNGTestRunnerDecorator</code> anymore.
   </li>
   <li>
      JMockit Coverage: fixed a bug in the checking of read-only status for output files, which
      caused the XHTML report and XML output file to not be generated when running with coverage for
      the first time.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the use of Reflection to find methods from the method name and actual
      argument values (not from specified parameter types).
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in <code>Delegate</code> support, where null arguments passed to a delegated
      method caused an exception to be thrown.
   </li>
   <li>
      Improvements to API documentation, with new links to example test classes in the CVS 
      repository.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.987 (August 17, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>New feature</strong>: the <code>@MockClass</code> annotation now has an
      "instantiation" attribute which controls when a mock instance is created (for each invocation
      of an instance mock method, only once for every time the mock class is applied/set up, or
      one mock instance for each mocked instance).
   </li>
   <li>
      Several changes and enhancements to JMockit Coverage:
      <ol>
         <li>
            Support for <em>incremental test suite execution</em> was updated for JUnit 4.5/4.6
            (JUnit 4.4 is not supported; JUnit 3.8 also is not supported, but individual tests in
            the JUnit 3.8 style inside a JUnit 4 suite are).
         </li>
         <li>
            The file "jmockit-incremental.jar" was created. It contains the incremental testing
            support, and whenever included in the classpath any JMockit-enabled tests (all those
            executed after JMockit gets initialized, whether they use the JMockit API or not) will
            be run incrementally (unless the feature is switched off, see below).
         </li>
         <li>
            Classes that generate output files (in XML or XHTML) that were previously inside
            "jmockit-coverage.jar" are now in separate jars, one for each type of output:
            "jmockit-coverage-xmlbasic.jar" (generates "coverage.xml" without call points),
            "jmockit-coverage-xmlfull.jar" (generates "coverage.xml" with call points),
            "jmockit-coverage-htmlbasic.jar" (generates "coverage-report" without call points), and
            "jmockit-coverage-htmlfull.jar" (generates "coverage-report" with call points).
         </li>
         <li>
            The jar file "jmockit-coverage.jar" will be added to the classpath implicitly if any
            one of the dependent jars (including "jmockit-incremental.jar") is explicitly added.
            Therefore, it is not necessary to explicitly include it in the classpath.
            It needs to be present in the same directory as those other jars, though.
         </li>
         <li>
            Added support for enabling/disabling coverage output re-generation according to whether
            the output file is read only or not. For XML output, the "coverage.xml" file in the
            working directory will be considered when running the test suite. For XHTML output, the
            "coverage-report/index.html" file will be considered. (If said file does not yet exist,
            then output will be generated and the corresponding writable file created.)
         </li>
         <li>
            Added support for enabling/disabling incremental testing according to whether the
            "testRun.properties" file in the working directory is read only or not.
            (If this file does not yet exist, then it will be created and left in a writable state.)
         </li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
      Minor improvement to JUnit 4 integration: now the <code>JMockitTest</code> base class can also
      be used by <code>@Suite</code> classes (those annotated with
      <code>@RunWith(Suite.class)</code>), in order to get JMockit initialized before the first
      test in the custom suite is executed.
   </li>
   <li>
      Implemented special handling for test execution environments where the method
      <code>ProtectionDomain#getCodeSource()</code> returns <code>null</code>. This is used by
      JMockit to discover the local path to "jmockit.jar", needed to auto-load the "java agent".
      If that method returns <code>null</code>, the entries in the execution classpath will be
      examined instead.
   </li>
   <li>
      Implemented workaround for an apparent JDK issue, where calling
      <code>isAnonymousClass()</code> in a nested class could lead to a failed attempt to load a
      sibling nested class.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused mocks set up in a JUnit <code>@BeforeClass</code> method, when defined
      inside a base test class, to be discarded.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the explicit verification (ie, done inside a verification block) of non-strict
      expectations, when the expectation was previously recorded: the lower limit on the invocation
      count was not verified when the number of iterations of the verification block is 1 (the
      default).
   </li>
   <li>
      Upgraded the versions of JUnit and TestNG used in all test suites to 4.7 and 5.10,
      respectively.
   </li>
   <li>
      Upgraded the version of Mockito used in the comparison test suite to 1.8.0.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.986 (July 27, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue where synthetic methods were inadvertently modified. (Such methods are created
      by the Java compiler in a nested class, to allow the outer class or another nested class to
      call private methods declared in the first nested class.)
   </li>
   <li>
      Removed an improper runtime dependency on <code>org.junit.Assert</code> from an internal
      class in the Expectations API (issue 26).
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the JUnit 4 and TestNG integrations, where the use of "before" methods in a
      base test class caused improper restoration of mocked classes just before the actual test
      methods began execution.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the on-demand initialization of JMockit (with "tools.jar" in the classpath),
      where the path to "jmockit.jar" in the classpath contained a space or non-ASCII character,
      causing an error saying "Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing" (issue 28). 
   </li>
   <li>
      Added an "Implementation-Version: n.nn" entry to "META-INF/MANIFEST.MF" in "jmockit.jar", and
      a "version.txt" file in the root of the full distribution zip file.
      "n.nn" will be the current version number for JMockit ("0.986" currently).
      This is only a convenience for users, to help tracking the version of JMockit in use
      (issue 32).
   </li>
   <li>
      Implemented support for thread-safe reentrant mocks (JMockit Annotations). See issue 30.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.985 (July 12, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in JMockit initialization which caused a hang when running JUnit 4 tests with
      <code>@RunWith(Suite.class)</code>, but without using either "-javaagent" or one of the
      mechanisms for on-demand initialization (<code>@RunWith(JMockit.class)</code>,
      <code>extends JMockitTest</code>, etc.).
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement to JUnit 4 integration: the <em>test suite</em> scope (in addition to the <em>test
      method</em> and <em>test class</em> scopes) is now supported in the automatic management of
      mocks and stubs set up by methods like <code>Mockit.setUpMocks(...)</code>, or through the
      <code>@UsingMocksAndStubs(...)</code> annotation.
      This means that any mock class (<code>@MockClass</code>) applied in a JUnit 4.5+ test suite
      class (annotated with <code>@Suite.SuiteClasses(...)</code>) will remain in effect for all
      tests in the suite.
   </li>
   <li>
      Upgraded the Hamcrest libraries embedded in jmockit.jar from version 1.1 to version 1.2.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue with user-provided non-final subclasses of <code>Expectations</code> or
      <code>Verifications</code>, which caused final subclasses to not be modified as they should.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed an issue in the automatic creation of expectations for invocations not previously
      recorded, where one that should be strict was created as non-strict.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement to the <code>Expectations#returns(value)</code> method, to facilitate returning
      multiple values for a single recorded method. Now two or more return values can be specified
      through "varargs" syntax, in a collection, or from an iterator. (Previously, this was possible
      only by calling the <code>returns</code> method multiple times.)
   </li>
   <li>
      Added a new sample test suite, based on
      <a href="http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/Mockito.LoginServiceExample">this</a> article.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the mocking of abstract classes without no-args constructors.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the mocking of abstract classes when a method that provides arguments to the
      super-constructor is provided, and constructors of the abstract class itself are allowed to
      be mocked.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.984 (July 5, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Enhancement to blocks of invocations, both the ordered (<code>Expectations</code>,
      <code>VerificationsInOrder</code>, <code>FullVerificationsInOrder</code>) and unordered ones
      (<code>NonStrictExpectations</code>, <code>Verifications</code>,
      <code>FullVerifications</code>), to allow the specification of the number of expected
      <em>iterations</em> for the whole set of invocations inside each block.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement to non-strict expectations: a minimum invocation count specified for an
      expectation will now be checked at the end of the replay phase (previously, only the maximum
      number of invocations was checked).
   </li>
   <li>
      Created the <code>Mockit.setUpStartupMocks(mock classes...)</code> method to facilitate the
      use of <em>startup mocks</em>, which allow applying arbitrary mock classes (annotated with
      <code>@MockClass</code>) at JMockit startup. This can be used to mock or stub out classes
      for an entire test suite run. The associated "jmockit.properties" configuration file even
      allow the creation of reusable jar files containing mock classes, that can be applied to a
      test suite simply by adding the jar file to the classpath.
   </li>
   <li>
      Changed the <code>ClassLoader</code> first used when reading class files from disk, from the
      "System" class loader (the one that regularly loads classes from production/test code) to the
      "Context" class loader associated with the current thread (which runs a test).
      This allows the execution of test suites in runtime environments (such as the JBoss
      application server) that load regular classes through a custom class loader.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the <code>Expectations#returns(...)</code> method when the return type was
      <code>SortedSet</code> or <code>SortedMap</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      One bug fix and a few small enhancements in JMockit Coverage.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.983 (June 29/30, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Implemented a workaround for an incompatibility introduced in release 0.98, which caused the
      <code>new Expectations(true)</code> instantiation to throw a <code>StackOverflowError</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement to mocked types so that mocks created by JMockit can implement multiple
      interfaces without the need to define a test-specific interface.
      A <em>type variable</em>, defined either by generifying the test class or a test method, can
      be declared to extend two or more interfaces (for example,
      <code>&lt;M extends Runnable & Collection&lt;?>></code>).
      Any mock field or parameter declared with this type variable (as in <code>M mock;</code>) will
      implement all interfaces.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement to <code>VerificationsInOrder</code> to support <em>partial ordering</em>.
      This allows (for example) the verification that one given method was executed first or last.
      It also allows the verification of arbitrary sequences of consecutive invocations.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement to <em>verifications</em> blocks to allow having several of them in the same test,
      just as it was already possible with <em>expectations</em> blocks.
      This facilitates reuse of verification code, and allows ordered and unordered blocks (usually
      one of each kind) to be combined in the same test.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug where non-private fields defined in a test class or in a base test class which
      doesn't use JMockit were also mocked. Now only fields annotated with one of the annotations
      for mocked types (<code>@Mocked</code>, <code>@NonStrict</code>, and <code>@Capturing</code>)
      are considered, as well as non-private fields in subclasses of the <code>Expectations</code>
      class, which may or may not be annotated.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the tracking of the current test class in a test run, where multiple instances
      of the corresponding field existed instead of only one.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed a bug in the JUnit 4.5+ integration, where mocks defined by one test class remained in
      effect for the next test class, if it used a different test runner than the default one from
      JUnit.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.982 (June 19, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>TestNG support</strong> added.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement of method <code>Expectations#with(Matcher&lt;T> argumentMatcher)</code>, so that
      it won't return <code>null</code> in most cases; now, calls like <code>with(is(false))</code>
      actually work as expected, passing <code>false</code> to the parameter.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement in the reusability of <code>Expectations/NonStrictExpectations</code> subclasses:
      now all such subclasses that are nested and <code>final</code>, even those that extend an intermediate
      <code>Expectations/NonStrictExpectations</code> subclass, will automatically call <code>endRecording()</code> at
      the end of the initialization block;
      those subclasses which are not <code>final</code> (and are nested or not) will be considered as intended for reuse
      through extension in individual tests, and therefore won't call <code>endRecording()</code> at the end of their
      own instance initialization.
   </li>
   <li>
      Attempts to mock native methods when running under JDK 1.5 (which doesn't support the redefinition of such
      methods, contrary to JDK 1.6) will now cause a user friendly exception to be thrown.
   </li>
   <li>
      A few bug fixes for less common situations.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.981 (June 14, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      New feature: class <code>FullVerifications</code> created as a subclass of
      <code>Verifications</code>, that allows the developer to write a full set of verifications for
      the mocked types used in a given test. Non-strict invocations that occur inside code under
      test but are not explicitly verified are considered unexpected, causing the test to fail.
      Also created the class <code>FullVerificationsInOrder</code>, which combines
      <code>FullVerifications</code> and <code>VerificationsInOrder</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      New package <code>mockit.integration.logging</code> with mock classes for popular logging
      frameworks: JDK logging, Log4j, Commons-Logging, SLF4J.
      The mock classes can be used with the <code>@UsingMocksAndStubs</code> annotation.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: the <code>Expectations#returns(Object)</code> method now accepts instances of the
      new <code>mockit.Delegate</code> interface. This allows test code to define return values or
      thrown errors/exceptions at replay time, based on test-specific logic. Works even for final
      and static methods of a mocked type.
   </li>
   <li>
      New sample test suite created, for comparison with the
      <a href="http://unitils.org">Unitils</a> mocking API.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fixed issue with certain Hamcrest matchers used inside a <code>Verifications</code> block.
      Fixed an issue with dynamic partial mocking.
      Fixed an issue in the stubbing out of abstract/native methods.
      Other fixes and small enhancements.
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>Migrating from a previous release</h4>
<p>
   The following changes need to be made to existing JUnit test suites, when migrating from JMockit
   release 0.97 (or older) to newer releases.
</p>
<ol>
   <li>First of all, recompile all test sources with the new jmockit.jar in the classpath.</li>
   <li>
      Any test classes that extended <code>junit.framework.TestCase</code> now need to extend
      <code>mockit.integration.junit3.JMockitTestCase</code>, unless the test suite is always run
      with "-javaagent:jmockit.jar".
      Alternatively, the test class can be converted to JUnit 4, with the addition of
      <code>@RunWith(JMockit.class)</code> to the class and of <code>@Test</code> to its test
      methods.
   </li>
   <li>
      In any test class which itself extends <code>mockit.Expectations</code>, if there is any
      initialization of instance fields outside of a <code>@Before/setUp</code> method, then a JUnit
      fixture setup method will have to be created to perform the initialization.
      This is necessary because now any mock fields of the test class will only be assigned
      <em>after</em> the test class instance is created (but before any setup or test methods are
      executed).
   </li>
   <li>
      If an <code>Expectations</code> subclass (which can be a test class, an anonymous inner class
      inside a test method, and so on) declares two or more mock fields of the same type or with a
      common base type, then these fields must mock exactly the same set of methods and constructors
      belonging to the common class types.
      By default, all methods and constructors are mocked, so this issue can only happen when
      (static) partial mocking is used, through the <code>methods</code> or <code>value</code>
      attribute of the <code>MockField/Mocked</code> annotation.
      So, if that's the case, simply copy the mock filters specified in one mock field to the
      others.
   </li>
   <li>
      JMockit now restores mocked classes automatically both for test-scoped and test class-scoped
      mocks.
      Consequently, none of the methods <code>Mockit.tearDownMocks()</code>,
      <code>Mockit.restoreAllOriginalDefinitions()</code>, or
      <code>Mockit.restoreOriginalDefinition(...)</code> need to be explicitly called anymore,
      unless a given test method really needs to restore some mocked class before the test completes
      its execution.
      This also means that classes that remained mocked between tests or from one test class to the
      next in the suite, will <em>not</em> remain mocked as before, but will be restored
      automatically either between individual tests, or from one test class to the next.
      Therefore, it will be necessary to set up the mocks again at the appropriate point (for
      example, in a <code>@Before</code> or <code>@BeforeClass</code> method when using JUnit 4).
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   It should be easy enough to adapt existing tests according to the incompatibilities listed above.
   If after making such changes some tests remain broken that weren't before, please let me know.
</p>

<h3>Version 0.98 (June 7, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Enhancement: for any <code>Expectations</code> anonymous subclass instance, the
      <code>endRecording()</code> method is automatically called at the end of the initialization
      block.
      Accordingly, the <code>Expectations</code> constructors which took a
      <code>boolean autoEndRecording</code> parameter were removed (a breaking API change).
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: mock fields declared in a test class which does <strong>not</strong> extend
      <code>Expectations</code> now will be assigned mock instances as soon as the test class is
      instantiated (before any tests or setup methods are executed).
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: ability to capture instances created inside code under test, from the
      initialization of a <code>Expectations</code> subclass to the end of the test, while mocking
      the concrete class, whichever it may be; each captured instance is assigned to the appropriate
      mock field (one or more times, with a specified upper limit). For example, this allows the
      mocking of a concrete class that implements an interface (used as the type of a mock field)
      and is dynamically loaded by production code sometime during the test.
   </li>
   <li>
      New <code>@Capturing</code> annotation which, similarly to the previous item, allows
      implementations of abstract types (interfaces or base classes) to be mocked on-demand,
      either when the implementation class is loaded by the JVM, or when the targeted scope (test
      class, test method) is entered during test suite execution.
   </li>
   <li>
      New method <code>onInstance(mock)</code> in <code>Expectations</code> to match the mock
      instance on which invocations occur between corresponding calls in the record and replay
      phases.
      By default, such instances can be different, so this method allows a test to compare them when
      they must be the same.
   </li>
   <li>
      New method <code>stubOut(classes)</code> in <code>Mockit</code> that stubs out the
      implementation of all methods, constructors, and static initializers in one or more given
      classes.
      Individual stubbed out methods/constructors can later be mocked by regular means
      (<code>setUpMocks</code>, <code>Expectations</code>).
   </li>
   <li>
      New annotation <code>@UsingMocksAndStubs(classes)</code> that can be applied to test classes
      so that one or more mock classes (annotated with <code>@MockClass</code>) are applied, and/or
      one or more regular classes are stubbed out. The scope for such mocks and stubs is the set of
      all tests in the annotated test class.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: <em>dynamic partial mocking</em>, where only the methods and constructors invoked
      in the record phase of an Expectations test remain mocked for the replay phase; when the
      replay phase begins, all methods/constructors not previously invoked will be back to their
      original definitions, so any calls to them will result in the execution of real production
      code.
      This is an alternative to the previous feature of <em>static partial mocking</em>, with the
      advantage that the desired methods/constructors to be mocked or not don't have to be
      explicitly specified in test code.
   </li>
   <li>
      Enhancement: stack traces for certain failed expectations now include a cause which points to
      the line of code executed in the replay phase which was the source of the failure; other
      small improvements to stack traces were also made.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: multiple results (values to return and/or exceptions/errors to throw) can now be
      recorded for a given expectation.
      Any corresponding invocation in the replay phase will then produce the next consecutive
      result as recorded.
   </li>
   <li>
      Expanded support for non-strict expectations:
      1) the new <code>@NonStrict</code> annotation indicates a mock on which all invocations will
      be considered non-strict;
      2) the new <code>NonStrictExpectations</code> class extends <code>Expectations</code>
      so that all invocations to mocked types inside the initialization block will be considered
      non-strict.
   </li>
   <li>
      New API for verification of non-strict expectations after the replay phase, provided by the
      new <code>Verifications</code> class, which shares many of the methods provided by the
      <code>Expectations</code> class.
      In addition, there is a <code>VerificationsInOrder</code> subclass which also verifies the
      order of invocation to the expectations of one or more mocked types.
   </li>
   <li>
      New sample test suite created, for comparison of the new Verifications API with the
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito">Mockito</a> API (where all expectations are
      non-strict by default, and preference is given to verifying invocations at the end of the test
      over recording expectations for them at the beginning of the test).
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: support for "mock parameters" in JUnit test methods. Everything which applies to
      a mock field also applies to such parameters.
      Tests written with the Expectations/Verifications API can greatly benefit from using
      parameters instead of local fields in an Expectations anonymous subclass, since the scope of
      each parameter is the whole test method.
   </li>
   <li>
      As a consequence of the previous new feature, the <code>@MockField</code> annotation was
      deprecated in favor of a new <code>@Mocked</code> annotation which can be applied to either
      fields or parameters.
   </li>
   <li>
      New utility class <code>Deencapsulation</code> created, with static methods to access fields,
      methods and constructors non-accessible to the test, mirroring the previously existing methods
      in the <code>Expectations</code> class (which continue to exist).
   </li>
   <li>
      Internal refactorings and other implementation enhancements and optimizations.
      A few bug corrections, including an important one related to reentrant mocks.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.97 (May 10, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      New feature: classes of the JRE (loaded by the bootstrap class loader) can now be mocked just
      like other classes; use of the "-Xbootclasspath/a" JVM argument is therefore no longer needed.
   </li>
   <li>
      Full support for mocking abstract classes implemented, where all abstract methods, including
      those inherited from super-classes, are implemented as mocks in the generated concrete
      subclass.
   </li>
   <li>
      Full support for mocking constructors, including the ability to specify which constructor
      in the super-class should be called, and with what arguments, which can be determined at test
      execution time.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: <strong>non-strict expectations</strong>, which can be recorded once and later
      replayed any number of times (including none) and in any order.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature in Expectations: mocked classes instantiated in the recording phase will have
      their instances automatically matched to the corresponding instantiations in the replay phase,
      eliminating the need to use an argument matcher in such cases (see next item).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Breaking API change</strong>: the method "withInstanceOf(Object)" in the Expectations
      class was renamed to "withInstanceLike". On the other hand, the new feature described in the
      previous item makes the need to use this method much less likely (in all the sample tests,
      no use remains).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Breaking API change</strong>: the two constructors in the Expectations class which had
      an "Object instanceWithMockFields" parameter were removed; now the enclosing class of each
      Expectations subclass will also be searched for mock fields, making those constructors
      redundant.
   </li>
   <li>
      Improvements in JMockit Coverage: finds source files in sub-directories of any "src" dirs;
      now considers for coverage all classes loaded by tests that are not inside jar files, instead
      of only the classes in the same packages as the tests.
   </li>
   <li>
      Updated existing samples to take advantage of the new features.
   </li>
   <li>
      Created new sample: full test suite for the Animated Transitions framework (still incomplete 
      in this version, with the remaining tests to be added shortly).
   </li>
   <li>
      Created new sample: equivalent JMockit tests for comparison with the PowerMock Tutorial test
      suite.
   </li>
   <li>Other bug corrections, improvements, and smaller new features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.96 (April 21, 2009):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      Implemented support for JUnit 4.5 (also works with JUnit 4.6).
   </li>
   <li>
      JMockit Expectations: improved Javadoc documentation; corrected a few bugs; created new helper
      methods; added new attributes to @MockField annotation.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: jmockit.properties (see default inside jmockit.jar) used for configuring startup
      mocks and external class transformers.
   </li>
   <li>
      A few corrections and improvements in JMockit Coverage (now reports interfaces properly).
   </li>
   <li>
      Created new sample: full test suite for the Timing Framework, with 60+ JMockit-based tests.
   </li>
   <li>
      Updated and expanded information on web site.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.95 (October 19, 2008):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      JMockit Expectations: added Javadoc documentation that was still missing; added more tests
      and corrected a few bugs.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.94/b/c (January 30/February 14/March 29, 2008):</h3>
<ul>
   <li>
      New feature: several new methods in mockit.Expectations for specifying expected invocation
      counts.
   </li>
   <li>
      JCoverage: corrections; intra-line feature replaced with "partiallyCovered" lines
      (until intra-line coverage support is fully implemented).
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: JMockit Coverage now accepts an empty class selection regex, then applying
      coverage only to packages containing the tests that are actually run.
   </li>
   <li>
      New feature: the standard tools which could be loaded by specifying "junit3", "junit4",
      "hibernate" or "coverage" in the JVM command line will now be loaded by default if not
      included in the command line but the corresponding jar file is in the classpath.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.93 (January 14, 2008):</h3>
<ul>
