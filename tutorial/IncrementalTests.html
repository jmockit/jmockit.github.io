<p>
   Suppose you have a test suite containing hundreds or thousands of tests.
   When changing production code in a local development environment, we would like to re-execute the test suite to make
   sure everything is still working.
   Re-running the whole suite for every small change will not be very productive, though, if each test suite execution
   takes more than a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
   One approach to reduce the total suite execution time, when a multi-CPU or multi-core machine is available, is to run
   tests in parallel.
   An smarter approach is to take advantage of the fact that in most cases, most of those tests simply don't need to be
   re-executed, because the production code they cover wasn't changed since the last test run.
   In other words, after an <em>increment</em> of functionality to the application (either by adding, changing, or
   removing production code) we have an increment of testing, by re-executing only that part of the whole test suite
   which is affected by the change in code under test.
</p>
<p>
   Therefore, what we want is to only re-execute the required minimum number of tests after each set of local changes to
   production code.
   That way, we should be able to frequently execute the test suite, independently of its size, in order to discover any
   regressions in the functionality of production code already covered by existing tests.
</p>
<p>
   In case the test code itself is changed, any tests added or modified will always be executed.
</p>

<h3 id="jar">Activating incremental test runs</h3>
<p>
   To have the ability of running tests in a JUnit or TestNG suite incrementally, add the following jar file to the
   classpath: <em><code>jmockit-incremental.jar</code></em>.
   This jar file depends on <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code>, which must be available in the same directory but does
   not need to be explicitly added to the classpath.
</p>
<p>
   As with any other tool or API in the toolkit, JMockit must be initialized before the first test is executed.
   See <a href="RunningTests.html">these instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
   When a test suite execution terminates, an output file of name <em><code>testRun.properties</code></em> is written in
   whatever was the working directory for the test run. When the file already exists it is overwritten.
</p>

<h3 id="switching">Turning incremental test runs on/off</h3>
<p>
   To facilitate turning incremental test runs on/off, the <em>read-only status</em> of the "testRun.properties" file is
   checked by JMockit at startup. If the file is currently marked as read-only in the OS, then the next test run will
   execute all tests.
</p>
<p>
   Notice that a Java IDE usually provides an easy mechanism to toggle the read-only status of a project file.
   In IntelliJ IDEA it is done by double clicking the status bar, with the desired file opened in the editor.
   In Eclipse there is a "Read only" check box in the "Properties" screen for the text file selected in the editor,
   which can be opened by typing "Alt + Enter".
