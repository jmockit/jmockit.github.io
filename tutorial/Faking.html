<p>
   In the JMockit toolkit, the <strong>Faking API</strong> provides support for the creation of <em>fake</em> implementations.
   Typically, a fake targets a few methods and/or constructors in the class to be faked, while leaving most other methods and constructors
   unmodified.
</p>
<p>
   Fake implementations can be particularly useful in tests which depend on external components or resources such as e-mail or web services
   servers, complex libraries, etc.
   Often, the fakes will be applied from reusable testing infrastructure components, not directly from a test class.
</p>
<p>
   The replacement of real implementations with fake ones is completely transparent to the code which uses those dependencies, and can be
   switched on and off for the scope of a single test, all tests in a single test class, or for the entire test run.
</p>

<h2 id="fakes">
   <a href="#fakes">1 Fake methods and fake classes</a>
</h2>
<p>
   In the context of the Faking API, a <em>fake method</em> is any method in a <em>fake class</em> that gets annotated with
   <code class="annotation">@Mock</code>.
   A fake class is any class extending the <code class="type">mockit.MockUp&lt;T></code> generic base class, where <code>T</code> is the type
   to be faked.
   The example below shows several fake methods defined in a fake class for our example "real" class,
   <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/security/auth/login/LoginContext.html">
      javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>public final class FakeLoginContext extends MockUp&lt;LoginContext> {
   @Mock
   public void $init(String name, CallbackHandler callback) {
      assertEquals("test", name);
      assertNotNull(callback);
   }

   @Mock
   public void login() {}

   @Mock
   public Subject getSubject() { return null; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   When a fake class is applied to a real class, the latter gets the implementation of those methods and constructors which have
   corresponding fake methods temporarily replaced with the implementations of the matching fake methods, as defined in the fake class.
   In other words, the real class becomes "faked" for the duration of the test which applied the fake class.
   Its methods will respond accordingly whenever they receive invocations during test execution.
   At runtime, what really happens is that the execution of a faked method/constructor is intercepted and redirected to the corresponding
   fake method, which then executes and returns (unless an exception/error is thrown) to the original caller, without this one noticing that
   a different method was actually executed.
   Normally, the "caller" class is one being tested, while the faked class is a dependency.
</p>
<p>
   Each <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> method must have a corresponding "real method/constructor" with the <em>same signature</em> in
   the targeted real class.
   For a <em>method</em>, the signature consists of the method name and parameters; for a <em>constructor</em>, it's just the parameters,
   with the fake method having the special name "<code>$init</code>".
</p>
<p>
   Finally, notice there is no need to have fake methods for <em>all</em> methods and constructors in a real class.
   Any such method or constructor for which no corresponding fake method exists in the fake class will simply stay "as is", that is, it
   won't be faked.
</p>

<h2 id="setUp">
   <a href="#setUp">2 Applying fake classes</a>
</h2>
<p>
   A given fake class must be applied to a corresponding real class to have any effect.
   This is usually done for a whole test class or test suite, but can also be done for an individual test.
   Fakes can be applied from anywhere inside a test class: a <code class="annotation">@BeforeClass</code> method, a
   <code class="annotation">@BeforeMethod</code> / <code class="annotation">@Before</code> / <code class="annotation">@BeforeEach</code>
   method (TestNG / JUnit 4 / JUnit 5), or from a <code class="annotation">@Test</code> method.
   Once a fake class is applied, all executions of the faked methods and constructors of the real class get automatically redirected to the
   corresponding fake methods.
</p>
<p>
   To apply the <code class="type">FakeLoginContext</code> fake class above, we simply instantiate it:
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void applyingAFakeClass() throws Exception {
   <strong>new FakeLoginContext()</strong>);

   // Inside an application class which creates a suitable <span class="type">CallbackHandler</span>:
   new LoginContext("test", callbackHandler).login();

   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Since the fake class is applied inside a test method, the faking of <code class="type">LoginContext</code> by
   <code class="type">FakeLoginContext</code> will be in effect only for that particular test.
</p>
<p>
   When the constructor invocation that instantiates <code class="type">LoginContext</code> executes, the corresponding "<code>$init</code>"
   fake method in <code class="type">FakeLoginContext</code> will be executed.
   Similarly, when the <code>LoginContext#login</code> method is called, the corresponding fake method will be executed, which in this case
   will do nothing since the method has no parameters and <code>void</code> return type.
   The fake class instance on which these invocations occur is the one created in the first part of the test.
</p>

<h3 id="eligibleMethods">
   <a href="#eligibleMethods">2.1 Kinds of methods which can be faked</a>
</h3>
<p>
   So far, we have only faked public instance methods with public instance fake methods.
   Several other kinds of methods in a real class can also be faked: methods with <code>protected</code> or "package-private" accessibility,
   <code>static</code> methods, <code>final</code> methods, and <code>native</code> methods.
   Even more, a <code>static</code> method in the real class can be faked by an <em>instance</em> fake method, and vice-versa (an instance
   real method with a <code>static</code> fake).
</p>
<p>
   Methods to be faked need to have an implementation, though not necessarily in bytecode (in the case of <code>native</code> methods).
   Therefore, an <code>abstract</code> method cannot be faked directly.
</p>
<p>
   Note that fake methods don't need to be <code>public</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="implementationClasses">
   <a href="#implementationClasses">3 Faking unspecified implementation classes</a>
</h2>
<p>
   To demonstrate this feature, lets consider the following code under test.
</p>
<pre><code>public interface Service { int doSomething(); }
final class ServiceImpl implements Service { public int doSomething() { return 1; } }

public final class TestedUnit {
   private final Service service1 = <strong>new ServiceImpl();</strong>
   private final Service service2 = <strong>new Service() { public int doSomething() { return 2; } };</strong>

   public int businessOperation() {
      return service1.doSomething() + service2.doSomething();
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The method we want to test, <code>businessOperation()</code>, uses classes that implement a separate interface,
   <code class="type">Service</code>.
   One of these implementations is defined through an anonymous inner class, which is completely inaccessible (except for the use of
   Reflection) from client code.
</p>
<p>
   Given a base type (be it an <code>interface</code>, an <code>abstract</code> class, or any sort of base class), we can write a test which
   only knows about the base type but where all implementing/extending implementation classes get faked.
   To do so, we create a fake whose target type refers only to the known base type, and does so through a <em>type variable</em>.
   Not only will implementation classes already loaded by the JVM get faked, but also any additional classes that happen to get loaded by
   the JVM during later test execution.
   This ability is demonstrated below.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public <strong>&lt;T extends Service></strong> void fakingImplementationClassesFromAGivenBaseType() {
   new MockUp<strong>&lt;T></strong>() {
      @Mock int doSomething() { return 7; }
   };

   int result = new TestedUnit().businessOperation();

   assertEquals(14, result);
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the test above, all invocations to methods implementing <code>Service#doSomething()</code> will be redirected to the fake method
   implementation, regardless of the actual class implementing the interface method.
</p>

<h2 id="initializers">
   <a href="#initializers">4 Faking class initializers</a>
</h2>
<p>
   When a class performs some work in one or more <em>static initialization blocks</em>, we may need to stub it out so it doesn't interfere
   with test execution.
   We can define a special fake method for that, as shown below.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void fakingStaticInitializers() {
   new MockUp&lt;ClassWithStaticInitializers>() {
      @Mock
      <strong>void $clinit()</strong> {
         // Do nothing here (usually).
      }
   };

   ClassWithStaticInitializers.doSomething();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Special care must be taken when the static initialization code of a class is faked.
   Note that this includes not only any "<code>static</code>" blocks in the class, but also any assignments to <code>static</code> fields
   (excluding those resolved at compile time, which do not produce executable bytecode).
   Since the JVM only attempts to initialize a class <em>once</em>, restoring the static initialization code of a faked class will have no
   effect.
   So, if you fake away the static initialization of a class that hasn't been initialized by the JVM yet, the original class initialization
   code will <em>never</em> be executed in the test run.
   This will cause any static fields that are assigned with expressions computed at runtime to instead remain initialized with the
   <em>default</em> values for their types.
</p>

<h2 id="invocation">
   <a href="#invocation">5 Accessing the invocation context</a>
</h2>
<p>
   A fake method can optionally declare an extra parameter of type <code class="type">mockit.Invocation</code>, provided it is the
   <em>first</em> parameter.
   For each actual invocation to the corresponding faked method/constructor, an <code class="type">Invocation</code> object will be
   automatically passed in when the fake method is executed.
</p>
<p>
   This invocation context object provides several <em>getters</em> which can be used inside the fake method.
   One is the <code>getInvokedInstance()</code> method, which returns the <em>faked</em> instance on which the invocation occurred
   (<code>null</code> if the faked method is <code>static</code>).
   Other getters provide the number of invocations (including the current one) to the faked method/constructor, the invocation arguments
   (if any), and the invoked member (a <code class="type">java.lang.reflect.Method</code> or
   <code class="type">java.lang.reflect.Constructor</code> object, as appropriate).
   Below we have an example test.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void accessingTheFakedInstanceInFakeMethods() throws Exception {
   new MockUp&lt;LoginContext>() {
      Subject testSubject;

      @Mock
      void $init(<strong>Invocation invocation</strong>, String name, Subject subject) {
         assertNotNull(name);
         assertNotNull(subject);

         // Verifies this is the first invocation.
         assertEquals(1, invocation.getInvocationCount());
      }

      @Mock
      void login(Invocation invocation) {
         // Gets the invoked instance.
         LoginContext loginContext = <strong>invocation.getInvokedInstance()</strong>;
         assertNull(loginContext.getSubject()); // null until subject is authenticated
         testSubject = new Subject();
      }

      @Mock
      void logout() { testSubject = null; }

      @Mock
      Subject getSubject() { return testSubject; }
   };

   LoginContext theFakedInstance = new LoginContext("test", new Subject());
   theFakedInstance.login();
   assertSame(testSubject, theFakedInstance.getSubject();
   theFakedInstance.logout();
   assertNull(theFakedInstance.getSubject();
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="proceed">
   <a href="#proceed">6 Proceeding into the real implementation</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Once a <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> method is executing, any additional calls to the corresponding faked method are also
   redirected to the fake method, causing its implementation to be re-entered.
   If, however, we want to execute the real implementation of the faked method, we can call the <code>proceed()</code> method on the
   <code class="type">Invocation</code> object received as the first parameter to the fake method.
</p>
<p>
   The example test below exercises a <code class="type">LoginContext</code> object created normally (without any faking in effect at
   creation time), using an unspecified <code>configuration</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void proceedIntoRealImplementationsOfFakedMethods() throws Exception {
   // Create objects used by the code under test:
   LoginContext loginContext = new LoginContext("test", null, null, configuration);

   // Apply fakes:
   ProceedingFakeLoginContext fakeInstance = new ProceedingFakeLoginContext();

   // Exercise the code under test:
   assertNull(loginContext.getSubject());
   <strong>loginContext.login();</strong>
   assertNotNull(loginContext.getSubject());
   assertTrue(fakeInstance.loggedIn);

   fakeInstance.ignoreLogout = true;
   <strong>loginContext.logout();</strong> // first entry: do nothing
   assertTrue(fakeInstance.loggedIn);

   fakeInstance.ignoreLogout = false;
   <strong>loginContext.logout();</strong> // second entry: execute real implementation
   assertFalse(fakeInstance.loggedIn);
}

static final class ProceedingFakeLoginContext extends MockUp&lt;LoginContext> {
   boolean ignoreLogout;
   boolean loggedIn;

   @Mock
   void login(Invocation inv) throws LoginException {
      try {
         <strong>inv.proceed();</strong> // executes the real code of the faked method
         loggedIn = true;
      }
      finally {
         // This is here just to show that arbitrary actions can be taken inside the
         // fake, <em>before</em> and/or <em>after</em> the real method gets executed.
         LoginContext lc = inv.getInvokedInstance();
         System.out.println("Login attempted for " + lc.getSubject());
      }
   }

   @Mock
   void logout(Invocation inv) throws LoginException {
      // We can choose to proceed into the real implementation <em>or not</em>.
      if (!ignoreLogout) {
         <strong>inv.proceed();</strong>
         loggedIn = false;
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the example above, <em>all</em> the code inside the tested <code class="type">LoginContext</code> class will get executed, even though
   some methods (<code>login</code> and <code>logout</code>) are faked.
   This example is contrived; in practice, the ability to proceed into real implementations would not normally be useful for
   <em>testing</em> per se, not directly at least.
</p>
<p>
   You may have noticed that use of <code>Invocation#proceed(...)</code> in a fake method effectively behaves like <em>advice</em> (from AOP
   jargon) for the corresponding real method.
   This is a powerful ability that can be useful for certain things (think of an interceptor or decorator).
</p>

<h2 id="reuse">
   <a href="#reuse">7 Reusing fakes between tests</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Often, a fake class needs to be used throughout multiple tests, or even applied for the test run as a whole.
   One option is to use test setup methods that run <em>before</em> each test method; with JUnit, we use the
   <code class="annotation">@Before</code> annotation; with TestNG, it's <code class="annotation">@BeforeMethod</code>.
   Another is to apply fakes inside of a test class setup method: <code class="annotation">@BeforeClass</code>.
   Either way, the fake class is applied by simply instantiating it inside the setup method.
</p>
<p>
   Once applied, a fake will remain in effect for the execution of all tests in the test class.
   The scope of a fake applied in a "before" method includes the code in any "after" methods the test class may have (annotated with
   <code class="annotation">@After</code> for JUnit or <code class="annotation">@AfterMethod</code> for TestNG).
   The same goes for any fakes applied in a <code class="annotation">@BeforeClass</code> method: they will still be in effect during the
   execution of any <code class="annotation">AfterClass</code> methods.
   Once the last "after" or "after class" method finish being executed, though, all fakes get automatically "torn down".
</p>
<p>
   For example, if we wanted to fake the <code class="type">LoginContext</code> class with a fake class for a bunch of related tests, we
   would have the following methods in a JUnit test class:
</p>
<pre><code>public class MyTestClass {
   @BeforeClass
   public static void applySharedFakes() {
      new MockUp&lt;LoginContext>() {
         // shared @Mock's here...
      };
   }

   // test methods that will share the fakes applied above...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   It is also possible to extend from a base test class, which may optionally define "before" methods that apply one or more fakes.
</p>

<h2 id="widerScopes">
   <a href="#widerScopes">8 Global fakes</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Sometimes, we may need to apply a fake for the entire scope of a test suite (all of its test classes), ie, a "global" fake.
   This can be done through external configuration, by setting a system property.
</p>
<p>
   The <strong><code>fakes</code></strong> system property supports a comma-separated list of fully qualified fake class names.
   If specified at JVM startup time, any such class (which must extend <code class="type">MockUp&ltT></code>) will be automatically applied
   for the whole test run.
   The fake methods defined in startup fake classes will remain in effect until the end of the test run, for all test classes.
   Each fake class will be instantiated through its no-args constructor, unless an additional value was provided after the class name (for
   example, as in "<code>-Dfakes=my.fakes.MyFake=anArbitraryStringWithoutCommas</code>"), in which case the fake class should have a
   constructor with one parameter of type <code class="type">String</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="advice">
   <a href="#advice">9 Applying AOP-style advice</a>
</h2>
<p>
   There is one more special <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> method that can appear in a fake class: the "<code>$advice</code>"
   method.
   If defined, this fake method will handle executions of each and every method in the target class (or classes, when applying the fake over
   unspecified classes from a base type).
   Differently from regular fake methods, this one needs to have a particular signature and return type:
   <code>Object $advice(Invocation)</code>.
</p>
<p>
   For demonstration, lets say we want to measure the execution times of all methods in a given class during test execution, while still
   executing the original code of each method.
</p>
<pre><code>public final class MethodTiming extends MockUp&lt;Object> {
   private final Map&lt;Method, Long> methodTimes = new HashMap<>();

   public MethodTiming(Class&lt;?> targetClass) { super(targetClass); }
   MethodTiming(String className) throws ClassNotFoundException { super(Class.forName(className)); }

   @Mock
   public Object $advice(Invocation invocation) {
      long timeBefore = System.nanoTime();

      try {
         return invocation.proceed();
      }
      finally {
         long timeAfter = System.nanoTime();
         long dt = timeAfter - timeBefore;

         Method executedMethod = invocation.getInvokedMember();
         Long dtUntilLastExecution = methodTimes.get(executedMethod);
         Long dtUntilNow = dtUntilLastExecution == null ? dt : dtUntilLastExecution + dt;
         methodTimes.put(executedMethod, dtUntilNow);
      }
   }

   @Override
   protected void onTearDown() {
      System.out.println("\nTotal timings for methods in " + targetType + " (ms)");

      for (Entry&lt;Method, Long> methodAndTime : methodTimes.entrySet()) {
         Method method = methodAndTime.getKey();
         long dtNanos = methodAndTime.getValue();
         long dtMillis = dtNanos / 1000000L;
         System.out.println("\t" + method + " = " + dtMillis);
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The fake class above can be applied inside a test, in a "before" method, in a "before class" method, or even for the entire test run by
   setting "<code>-Dfakes=testUtils.MethodTiming=my.application.AppClass</code>".
   It will add up the execution times for all executions of all methods in a given class.
   As shown in the implementation of the <code>$advice</code> method, it can obtain the <code>java.lang.reflect.Method</code> that is being
   executed.
   If desired, the current invocation count and/or the invocation arguments could be obtained through similar calls to the
   <code>Invocation</code> object.
   When the fake is (automatically) torn down, the <code>onTearDown()</code> method gets executed, dumping measured timings to standard
   output.
